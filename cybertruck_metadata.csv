Chevy Silverado EV,"A $100K truck?  Okay, so is the Cybertruck or a MX.  It's too much money, but okay.  They put the ridiculous Avalanche-style faux chase rack shape behind the cab...FAIL.  For a $100K electric truck, they couldn't put ELECTRIC step sides on it, like every other ICE truck out there?  They had to staple some cheap plastic step-sides on it?  FAIL.  Ridiculous glass roof.  FAIL.  Rear seat room is great, but it folds down to accommodate the idiotic mid-gate.  FAIL. As a longtime truck owner, so many dumb decisions make this thing DOA for me.  I'd love to own an EV truck, but even if I wanted to drop $100K on a truck like this, I couldn't consider it, because it would pi$$ me off every time I looked at it or tried to use it.  At least on the Cybertruck, the rear seat lifts so I can use it for my dogs or other cargo I don't want to put in the bed.  Really, really disappointed in this truck from GM.

Don't forget to tell them under 40 degrees, the one pedal driving is not available as well as the 4-wheel drive is disabled. Until the outside temp goes up. Not the battery temp. Don't forget to tell them they had to replace batteries on a few. I'm still waiting to see if I get another high voltage problem again. And mine replaced.  After all that. I do love the Truck. Really, it's outstanding not to have to go to the gas station. Very comfortable.. Use the heat or air on it and mileage goes down a little faster than you'd like, but not too bad. Have 1400 miles on mine so far.",2025-02-26,YouTube
Chevy Silverado EV,"Don't say anything passive aggressive about the range issue like that. I need not to spend the same amount of money or more on an offshoot vehicle type that doesn't match the same everything as a standard vehicle I already have does. I didn't ask for this crackpot stupidity, so I'm not accepting any compromises by its nature. Every vehicle costs way too much, and you get less and less for it. I want what I'm used to because I have every right to expect it. And I'm not about the ""you can live with this minimum"" life. That's a miserable existence. You can be progressive all you want, but keep your personal takes on hot topics to yourself. That's not what you get paid for. Just give us the specs and competitor comparisons.

Chevy Silverado EV,"I love the specs on it, but its wayy too big",2024-08-11,YouTube
Chevy Silverado EV,"I love you EV test guys. You have no clue about the downfalls of this technology. First, EV Vehicles are not flying off the lots. Second, why would anyone pay 75,000$ for a work truck and $105,000 for a nicer RST. your towing is cut in half once any tonnage is put on. Third, ok, so you have a trailer attached, how are you going to charge your truck, at a charging station, most places only have 2 or 4 stations. If someone is there charging their car, you have to unhook your trailer and then charge your truck. Fourth, and this is the big one, nobody has thought of, if we pay a gas tax, to go for the repairs of the highway, wouldn't there be a tax on electricity once this really becomes popular.? So, how much will this be.? And this last one I love the best.! For all you EV people who say, don't be a hater to electric vehicles, we're out to save the planet from emissions from gas or diesel vehicles. Where do you think 99% of the electricity comes from to charge your EV, From FOSSIL FUELED PLANTS.!! Get a clue. Just love, hey Google, where's the next charging station, as you are towing with almost no range left. And Google says,... sorry, your screwed, no cell service. Meanwhile, there's always a gas station up ahead. And the $35,000+ extra you spent for an EV, buys a helluva lot of fuel.",2023-10-24,YouTube

Chevy Silverado EV,"I owned an Avalanche for a long, long time and I miss that feature so much! I wish it was more affordable:(",2024-10-10,YouTube
Chevy Silverado EV,"I purchased this exact RST first edition and the review is close to the mark with my observations of their vehicle.  I bought this truck for the very reason to solve towing my boat and my equipment trailer up and down Rt 95 RI to GA taking several trips a year.  The ICE (Duramx) based pick up that I replaced this year was getting expensive to operate as a daily driver and a tow vehicle.  I will disagree with the assessment that this pick up truck is not well suited for the road trip demands because it is an EV.  That is actually not the case, the built in NAV is very capable of direct route planning for road trips with and without the trailing involvement.   I think that statement does not describe the reality of the charging infrastructure in 2025.",2025-02-05,YouTube

Chevy Silverado EV,I saw a white one on the road Tuesday it was moving pretty fast so I couldn't really see how good it looks in person to give an honest assessment on what I thoughy about it truthfully tho the cyber truck is UGLY and PATHETIC like a toyota the cyber truck is a tasteless ugly piece of GARBAGE it's an atrocity on video on paper and in person the only complaint at the moment I have about the Silverado EV is the absence of Android Auto that's a stupid decision by GM that I know 100% of other consumers can and would agree with im more than sure of that I mean come on its 2024 skimping on features can and will could be a deal breaker for some customers and for a truck that costs almost $100 Grand GM y'all have to do better it's always small but idiotic and boneheaded decisions like these that GM makes that push customers to other brands GM always shoots themselves in the foot they been doing that for like Forever charge outrageous and ridiculous prices but offer vehicles with minimal and mediocre features GM has been building vehicles for decades and they still have a stone age mindset by now you'd think they wisen up and got with the program but ain't nothing changed,2024-08-31,YouTube

It has good payload and can tow well for short to medium distances, it is capable off road now too thanks to the recent software update. I don't understand that comment other than for people who need it for medium to long haul towing, and if that is the case I don't think any electric truck is great for that yet. The range on this Chevy EV is impressive though. That is where Cybertruck really dropped the ball.",2024-05-23,YouTube

I was surprised that Marques referenced the Rivian and even the douchemobiles Hummer / Cybertruck more than comparing it with the F150 Lightning Flash or Lariat model.  That seems like the likely competition. As I look at the market in Feb 2025, the F150 with a fully respectable 3xx mile range is $20-40K less than this Silverado.

Chevy Silverado EV,"More depreciation! You have to own a Ev for over 4 or 5 years. To justify its impact over ice powered vehicles. Most people trade their vehicles in before then. So your Ev Vehicle drops by 2-3 times in value more than a comparable ice vehicles. How much is a 10 year old truck 1/2 ton worth? $20,000. A 10 year old Rivian will only be worth 10-15%. Who wants to stop 3-4 more times to charge (20min-1hr++) on a road trip? Yes my family road trips . 14760 in USA. We have factories and colleges in our town. Great jobs low cost of living. Small town so u travel over 100 miles to get to family friendly fun. Electric vehicles are 10-15 away from being practical. The government can‚Äôt afford to give incentives or to grow the infrastructure. Try ice vehicles till about 2035 or 2040. How is 8000 lbs going to handle a 5000lbs vehicle in a crash? Great?

It‚Äôs too expensive, it takes far too long for a fill-up, its towing capacity is a small fraction that of a conventionally fueled truck and the electric charging and electric distribution infrastructures in the US are still woefully inadequate for widespread adoption of electric vehicles. ¬†<br><br>Note that we can now easily refill a 400-450 mile range vehicle from empty in less than 10 minutes.  Even so, it‚Äôs not uncommon for there to be a line of 2-3 cars during peak demand periods.  Imaging now what the lines will be like when a recharge a 250-300 mile range vehicle that takes 45-60 minutes to recharge from empty.  <br><br>Neither technology nor infrastructure are ready to support electric vehicles at even 10% market penetration.

The upgrade isn‚Äôt significant but it‚Äôs the latest greatest tech and the old drops 50% in Value. Not to mention the charging and fear of running out of juice when taking trips. How much range does it have while towing? I leased a EV and it advertised 283 miles for the range. I actually got 193 miles per charge. I work in the car industry and trade every year for a new vehicle. I gave EVs a chance and man the tech is amazing, but honestly I would never purchase another one. These vehicles need an emergency engine maybe a 2 cylinder with reserved fuel with a 50 mile range just in case. The Hummer was hot for a second and now we can‚Äôt give them away. Mercedes is having the same issue. They made going green a poor issues while only the top 1% can afford the EVs in the first place.

Chevy Silverado EV,"You cannot compare a 1/2 ton vehicle to 3/4 on ride. The F250 3/4 hauls more then twice the weight in the bed and tows over twice as much as that EV, so yes the F250 does not ride like a unibody SUV with a pickup bed.  If your going to compare ride you should have compared it to the Lightning which rides much better than a 3/4 ton truck. I would be interested in how efficient it is  both Dodge and Chevy went with huge batteries that are almost twice as large as the Lightning's . Those big batteries make both the Chevy and Dodge EV's weight over a thousand pounds more then the Lightning too.  I know range is a big thing but that battery size and cost to replace is going to be nuts. I think the Silverado EV is more of a SUV with a trunk that has less pickup bed payload than a Ford Ranger and almost a 1,000 pound less than the Lightning.  Unibody will not work well as a Frame like real trucks have they tired it a long time ago and it did not work well. That RST model is just one ugly SUV with a pickup bed.  How in the world do you think they look okay is beyond me. Fords ground up EV truck will be out in 2025 will have wait see how this all turns out.",2023-07-02,YouTube

Ford F-150 Lightning,Great video!,2024-11-05,YouTube
Ford F-150 Lightning,"Great video!  Like you, once I experienced an EV, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôd have to be crazy to go back to a gas vehicle.  It‚Äôs actually MORE convenient than having a gas car/truck because you leave your house every day with a full tank and hardly ever have to stop to fill up (only on road trips), and hardly ANY maintenance.  I‚Äôve been driving Tesla‚Äôs for 10 years now.  Once the F-150 Lightning comes with the NACS charger built-in, I‚Äôll be buying one.  Also, it would be nice to know what the rear, lockable, tonneau (?) cover costs?  One other thing: when is there going to be a convertible EV?  Ford should make either a Mustang or Thunderbird convertible EV.  That‚Äôs one thing I miss, having had a 2-door Mercedes hard-top convertible awhile back.  It was turbo-charged, too, so it would leave most cars in the dust.  Man, I loved that car, especially driving around in the country in the summertime!",2024-06-13,YouTube

The bluetooth phone call some time doesn't work when I call out or getting call in, it makes noise can't hear anything, when I connected apple carplay never have that issue. the other thing is the towing mileage is really suck, I got about only 180km to 200km about 130 miles towing range(empty trailer), and one time I passed the exit by accident, it stopped on the road when it still showed 6km left, only 3km far way from charging statation, my tesla never drop me when it become ""0"".",2024-01-30,YouTube

I don't really need a pick up since i don't tow or put anything on the bed and the gas consumption is crazy, but with this being electric I may actually consider it because i like the idea of a big cabin for  my 2 kids.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I remember around 2008-2012 or so when everyone was looking at the rise of smartphones and tablets and predicting that the desktop computer was dying. It didn't happen. Sure desktops account for a much smaller % of all computing tasks today, but they aren't dead. There's no way to do heavy computing tasks (editing photo/video, gaming, coding, etc) on an iPad, as much as Apple wants you to believe otherwise. <br><br>EVs are in a similar position now. Everyone is predicting that soon they will be everywhere and there will be no place for ICE vehicles anymore. But I think that actual working vehicles that really do need to haul thousands of pounds will be ICE for a long time. Even as 90% of all cars on the road become EVs there will still be a need for towing a very long distance, and that's where ICE cars will shine. The Lightning is the equivalent of the iPad Pro. More capable than the average iPad or iPhone (or a non-truck EV, if you will) but not capable of going tow to tow (lol) with a real F150/desktop computer.",2023-07-27,YouTube
Ford F-150 Lightning,"I sounds like you actually really like this vehicle.   It is leagues a head of the other BEVs below $100,000 for being a large comfortable four adult vehicle with good driving characteristics and incredible ride well into the 80 mph area.  That's compared to non sports BEVs.  Tesla appears to be the only BEV that has software development and continues maintenance correct.  As lacking as the Ford dealership service experience has been, being a Ford does mean there is a huge network of Ford dealers across North America that Tesla lacks.    I'm a sports sedan guy, but the Lighting once its software bugs are reasonably smoothed out and major upgrade in battery ability I'd seriously consider when needing a large comfortable fast vehicle for four adults.  All BEV really only make reasonable sense with over night home charging.   The goal is 5 minute fast charging.   That is still slower than filling a gasoline car, but it is close enough to be thought comparable.   That is 12C charging verses 4C charging of 15 minutes for the new CATL LFP battery.",2024-03-30,YouTube

You need to go to a specific Technician that is trained in electrical vehicles so you know that your truck is going to come out of the shop in one piece. Another thing is yes you‚Äôre saving a bunch of money in gas. However, these electrical vehicles that are pushed on us are very expensive upfront as well. What they should do is make an electrical vehicle that is The cost of an regular sedan so that people can try it out and once they see how useful it is, and how affordable it is, and how much money they‚Äôre saving then once the car crap out they can go and possibly buy a more expensive model of an electrical vehicle. Most of us don‚Äôt spend on vehicle that we don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôre gonna like it as much with all the footage pushed around about EV cars catching on fire EV cars bringing a house on fire cars locking their family inside updating. it‚Äôs a very expensive mistake.",2024-08-03,YouTube

Ford F-150 Lightning,My favorite thing about the lightning is that it isn't trying too hard like nearly every other EV out there between gimmicks and funky designs. You'll alienate a lot fewer people from your product simply by making it like a normal vehicle that people are used to and not this spaceship looking thing. Not to mention that parts and accessories are mostly interchangeable with the normal ICE version.,2024-03-29,YouTube

Ford F-150 Lightning,"One cannot dismiss the $7500 tax credit in the equation. Interestingly the $4000 used EV tax credit, though for less than $25,000 also keeps the used price higher. Like it or not, these trucks on new purchase and sale are federally subsidized $11,500. Also with Ford losing money on them doesn't mean the resale value should be low, it just means the manufacturing and R&D costs far outweigh sales. As they continue to strip back options, increase the price as they have with the 2025 model, these trade-in values should stay decent. Especially so if they never LFP batteries last longer. You also see that as part of the residual value on a lease, the bank is thinking the same thing.  These trucks are holding their value better than any other EV after the hype drops.",2024-08-31,YouTube

As for towing: Again, if you're towing more than 4 tons on the regular you're in the wrong truck. Anyone that's pulled more than 3 or 4 tons with a regular pickup knows the handling goes to shit and braking is precarious at best. Past the 4 ton mark you need to be in a F250 or F350 dually.

They are NOT selling because FORD raised the MSRP to over $80,000 USD and THAT disqualifies them, from the EV credit of $7500... S150 lightning costs the average buyer almost $20,000 more per truck!  So FORD has recently (a few days ago) a PRICE CUT of $10,000 per Vehicle off the MSRP! So LARIAT Trim with EXT Battery is now about $78,000!!!

GMC Hummer EV,H3 wasnt got the road is was a jeep sized offroad vehicle with better mpg and different capabilities easier for the average person. It had a v8 also in some inline 5 was fine for offroading v8 better tho and sounds better. A little lift and whatever jeeps do aka tires a must and lift and suspension tops. Hummer all u need is tires really and 4or pretty sure they all stock 4x4.  But legit you can buy the truck and go almost anywhere maybe change the tires or get it from the factory with offroad tires......  most people dont offroad they say get jr own tires if u want. Then if you get a little lift you're more than good which is what allot of jeeps. Tires will give ground clearance then lift. Usually you dont need more tha  tires. And lift will help with tires depending how big they are.,2023-02-21,YouTube

I'm not in a hurry to buy a truck in an imminent sense....so I'm curious as to when Tesla get around to remedying some of the obvious ""flaws"" or bugs whether its the comically small & cheap rear-view mirror ( best answer is replace with a dedicated camera - mirror system )...or the lack of driver stalk controls, or the tiny headlights .....things like that.....meanwhile Rivian is like Tesla's younger brother....bold, brash, has many if the same people, and seems determined to build high-quality stuff......I like the range possible  of the Rivian R1T....and lots of other aspects of it........your videos reassure me it would be a good buy even at similar dollars.....",2025-02-13,YouTube

Rivian R1T,"Hello there, 1st/ I like your Rivian, which I honestly believe it is a superior EV vs many others out there. Although, I use to own a ‚Äú22 Mustang MachE GT recently, Dual Motor & Extended Battery too, as well as rated 270 miles range. All I can say is that I still like the Rivian brand for whatever reason.. Anyway, Rivian in the past used to have 4 motors, or one for each wheel IF I am not wrong but not sure, and then the batteries a little better than my MachE GT in my opinion. Moreover, I don‚Äôt want to be the individual that sound very ‚Äúagainst such EV technology‚Äù which I personally believe that it is a nice way of transportation, BUT in the same time it has its one benefits as well as it has also MANY downsides too, regrettably, and take it from a guy that used to own one EV too.. I paid over $77.4k for mine in Dec 2022, and close to a year later I was crying for my money spent in that vehicle. Not to mention the unbelievable DEPRECIATION of my EV like many others out there, that got down to less than half of what I paid for, pretty much close to a year later, since there were so many available on the market and NOT many people were interested to buy them. Luckily I was able to traded in mine and got rid of it, but losing more than half or $38k back only. Therefore a ding of $39.4k lost, when in fact I should have got close to what I paid for considering that I did not have many miles on board and the car was looking immaculate. 2nd/ Here is what I try to explain to many people out there and IF this sound great ‚Äútip‚Äù or something that might resonate with many of you while considering such EVs, as well as what it trully means to own one, and the issues that some of you will find later on then great, otherwise, do what each and everyone of you would like. 3rd/ I am strongly encouraging everyone out there that is looking for one EV to listen my point of view and my side of the story, before considering committing and buying one. 4th/ The cost of operating one EV it might sound cheaper and more convenient, BUT in reality it is NOT, regrettably. For example: the distance that ‚Äúyou‚Äù think that you can travel and that is listed on your dash, IT IS NOT a real distance that you might travel in reality while monitoring the true miles traveled. Meaning, lets just say that in a full battery state the dash might tell you that you will be able to travel about 270 miles, BUT in reality you and your vehicle will travel ONLY 190 miles max, and that is only IF you are not using your A/C or heating, have to go up hills or stuck in traffic. Now, ‚Äúyou‚Äù will start panicking when ‚Äúyou‚Äù see that you get close to half of ‚Äúbattery‚Äù charge state left juice and then ‚Äúyou‚Äù immediately NEED to find another charging station so that ‚Äúyou‚Äù will NOT get stuck in some whatever place in this country, and NOT be able to reach your destination or even worse, go and deplete your battery totally, and then requires towing bottom line, let alone that is NOT good for the battery if ‚Äúyour‚Äù battery/car gets there. The manufacturer stated pretty clear, try to avoid driving your EV car while having less than 30% of the battery and avoid at all cost going to ‚ÄúZero‚Äù.. Also, repeated ‚ÄúFast Charging‚Äù it is NOT recommended either, since the batteries will start depleting much faster than normal, ‚Äúmeaning wear and tear‚Äù. Besides that, it is quiet significant the price that EV owners need to pay almost every 90-100 traveled miles, so that ‚Äúyou‚Äù do not get to risk finding another charging station. I have seen numerous time this issue, while I owned my EV, which was driving to a place and then NONE of the charging stations available were working, which force me to drive all over the places and find one working.. Not sure how many times I was ‚Äúsweating‚Äù so bad and got so amped up as well as super anxiety going through my body, thinking that this new charging place might have the same issues.. So, it can be pretty scary.. 5th/ The cost of charging it can get pretty nasty, as many of already encountered yourself, or $0.45/kwh or even higher which is crazy, considering that I live in CA, and I thought that here it is super pricy, but $0.67/Kwh as some people claimed they encountered in some places then that it is insane.. So, traveling about 100 miles and then charge again, NOT only it is horrible and super annoying, but also a wasteful day and time, doing that daily and few times in between, while you travel, so that you can go a decent distance being in your Vacay or somewhere else as daily needed, besides shorter distances too.. 6th/ The center gravity of the vehicle it is very low, not to mention that the tires wear out much faster than the ICE regular cars, while these batteries are very heavy too, and that put a lot of pressure on your ‚Äúrubbers and breaks‚Äù, not to mention that anything that you can and will hit with your undercarriage since the batteries are so low to the ground surface, and can easily be destroyed while running over something more dangerous or debris.. 7th/ So, the MOST discouraging it is the fact that in 6-7 years MAX depending on how much you use your EV, then ‚Äúyou‚Äù will be face with an enormous bill, such as replacing the entire battery pack, since these that your car have already, are getting less mileage and not hold the ‚Äújuice‚Äù as much anymore as when the batteries were new. The cost of such batteries replacement it is according with as many brands out there, or more than $20k+, in many cases, which is astonishing in my opinion, meaning I rather pay for gasoline gradually and change the engine oil as well as filters regularly, vs coming with a $20k+ for new batteries. Let alone that when replacing the entire battery pack then most likely ‚Äúyou‚Äù need to change the glycol fluid I would assume most likely, since that is what cool the batteries, and it will be drain instead of reuse I would assume. Also, I am pretty much sure that some ‚ÄúHigh Voltage Cables‚Äù might need to be replaced too, since these are the ones that could be considered a fire hazard due to so much usage, and burning (wear and tear) of these cables, or perhaps the rubber sealing used gets bed and therefore might need to be replaced in order to make prevent the rain/water of getting in.. I guarantee you that the technicians will find some craaap to inflate your repair bills for sure.. 8th/ The replacement of the batteries pack it is a VERY complicated thing to do, just google it, and NOT many shops could do that I would assume, since there is a process to be followed and specialized personnel that is qualified to work with such High Voltage power/battery, de-energizing, etc, let alone that these shops need a specific jacks for such heavy replacements/repairs.. And for you folks that think that the Warranty of ‚Äúyour‚Äù EV battery it is not an issue, and that the warranty covers these defective batteries, then all I can tell you is that the manufacturer will replace ONLY the cells/modules that are considered useless, and then install only few vs the whole battery pack, not to mention that they will replace only these defective modules or cells, with A refurbished batteries, just to get you in your way and be done with your warranty for the time being.. Meaning few weeks later or perhaps few month later, ‚Äúyou‚Äù will be back in the shop looking for another swap of batteries, repeating the same process until ‚Äúyour car‚Äù is out of that total warranty, in my opinion and allegedly since we kinda know how the dealership kinda works in general.. I heard some people saying that the cost of replacing your battery pack can go as high as $27K+ too, depending on which type of battery your car might need. 9th/ The whole US infrastructure of such EV charging stations it is NOT even covering as much as it is necessary considering the increase of EV owners, and if that continue to grow in ownership then the lack and the capacity could be overwhelming, therefore it could get ugly and the waiting lines at the charging stations be an issue for miles, which will get people in fist fights in order to charge their EVs, claiming all kinds of ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù, due to impatience and arrogance while tired of waiting I would assume.. 10th/ Charging at home can get expensive too, considering the hikes of energy prices or cost overall as far as I have seen, let alone the inconvenience of watching such process while you have your car parked outside and not into any garage too. There were unbelievable disgusting instances in which other individuals parked next to your car and charge theirs vehicles instead.. 11th/ Having an ‚ÄúEV‚Äù, then ‚Äúyou‚Äù can NOT travel remotely or off grid much, since there could be NO charging stations anywhere you might go or want to go.. So, in the end, the money that people might think that they save IF that is even a possibility, then each and everyone of ‚Äúyou‚Äù will have to come with a big chunk of money when you change your battery pack few year down the road, depending as I said it d how much you truly use your EV daily, besides IF you don‚Äôt have ANY other problems with anything else, which the EVs have their own issues too, as we all can see, let alone the high cost of repairs and insurance, once again, too. I personally got back to a gas car, in the end, since I got tired of all of things as stated above.. I will ONLY recommend such EV technology for retired individuals, which these don‚Äôt go to work each and every day, and don‚Äôt have to charge daily their vehicles, as well as for people that have their own garage and keep the EV vehicles out of the elements, due to a certain recommended temperature in which the battery can prolong their lifespan..

I really dig the old school look but I‚Äôm trying to get used to that high seat, I was going to buy an ultra limited, but I was a little concerned about the weight in terms of being top-heavy and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would really do the kind of riding that it was built for‚Ä¶.. my previous bike was a 2002 Road king classic in Black which I really loved.  I like the old school with the white wall tires and the spoked wheels which is what attracted me to the highway king. Too many bikes today are simply black or gray years ago. There was a lot more color on motorcycles. I‚Äôd like to see Harley come out with more color options and bring back more chrome.  The last thing I‚Äôll say because this is running long is that the 114 engine is really impressive as compared to my twin cam from years ago. I see no reason to put a stage two or four into it but that‚Äôs just me thanks for the video. Have a great day.",2024-01-20,YouTube

Rivian R1T,"It's hard to take Rivian seriously when we have no idea if they will go bankrupt in the next year or two. Consumers are paying through the nose for this status symbol and being asked to also take on the risk that Rivian goes bust. As for the truck, it's a small, mid size truck with limited truck utility. If you are someone who wants an EV truck, there are far better options. Who cares about a truck pull, really a dumb idea from Edmunds to even do it, as if that makes a difference when buying a truck. Take your Rivian to Home Depot and try to do actual work with it, like loading sheets of plywood and then put it next to the GM EV truck offering. No competition. Load a bunch of 29er mountain bikes in the bed, and see what kind of room you have, I know the answer, none. We head to the trails and see people trying to shoe horn their mountain bikes in the bed and it is like a clown car. Even the new Tacoma long bed is far superior in terms of utility, let alone a real full size truck for mountain bike adventures. When the Rivian failed and would not start, how long did it take before it was towed? How long before you got a loaner? How long before the repair was done and how much was the repair cost? Even if the warranty covered it, it would be interesting to know the real world cost of the repair, give us real data where you have it.",2023-10-12,YouTube

I have the exact same launch edition (even the same color) and I've got the squeaky door handle but not the other squeaks/ rattles.   <br>I'm amazed you didn't mention the toneau cover. Frankly, that's my biggest gripe as mine has been broken for over a year now. Rivian is working on a replacement design but they promised to deliver it last summer and summer is gone. My biggest 'minor' gripe is the lack of Apple Carplay or Android Auto support. I want WAZE and the navigation for the Rivian is still lacking in several ways.

This clearly shows they're rushing the manufacturing model rollout.   Absolutely absurd assembly.   It's common knowledge, that the more complicated the engineering of your machinery, the more expensive it is to maintain and the higher the risk for malfunction.<br><br>I'll stick with my German hybrid - as far as I can see, Electric cars are still in the Stone Age.   And if you bought a Cybertruck (lamesit uncool name ever) - You're a nerd.  Everyone laughs at your car when you drive around except 10-year-old children.

To be fair, Cycbetruck probably works better in some respects, but it is already dated, and in decline because it is an over-priced boat anchor of a working truck and just wretched excess.

On Tesla cars,  when you want to change lanes, you get a warning of the blind spot on the center screen down low in the center dash console, instead of a sound and blinking light on your rear view mirrors where it should be according to ergonomics and natural human instinct. Tesla bombed when it tries to communicate everything throw the computer screen in the center down low in the dashboard.",2024-12-01,YouTube

Also build quality compared to like a Chevy and ford seems worst. To be fair this is like 1 gen issues like I remember watching a video of the front bar for the wheels broke and did the üëâüëà look so yes it‚Äôs nice for a road car but anything more I‚Äôm concern lol<br><br>Edit: alright I got to admit something else too. Most tucks are not doing truck things. They are on the road 1000% agree and if those who need a truck to do truck things I think most of the time they will be using stronger trucks like 250-350 in fords and chevys numbering scheme. Vs a normal 150 or 1500 I will say though I want it be good in off road conditions which. I think the cyber truck can manage especially for the ground clearance I just wonder on worst conditions like mud, slopes, getting out from being stuck, stuff like that.",2025-02-18,YouTube

Tesla Cybertruck,"James the cyber truck reminds me of a very badly put together attempt at making a light reconnaissance tank, plus how do you get out of the tank when it catches fire - the doors are electronic and do not automatically open, so it could be classed as a 'cooker' as well.  European roads are not wide enough for it plus the monstrosity does not comply with European/UK regulations or Health and Safety. Supposedly bullet proof and it does stop a basic .22 from a target rifle but nothing else. The view through the front window is not safe and you have no idea of what is in front of you for some 30 feet, the view through the rear window is even more restricted and the window wipers are ridiculous.",2025-03-24,YouTube

Tesla Cybertruck,"""Supposed to rule the roads"" is kind of indicative of the problem they have (as well as other EVs to some extent). Media hype does not equal actual hype and, with this variety of vehicle, promises made by the media and these companies have not followed suit with actual real world performance.

As a good example, my team at work was afforded the opportunity to benchmark a Rivian the other day. It was extremely fast and had impressive safety tech with an aesthetically pleasing interior. That's about it for positives. The vehicle cost well over $100k but looked like $20k or less from outside as it showed a lot of clear indications that the company is kinda just new to making cars (Rivian has had good partners here and is better than Tesla's many more issues with the same thing). Body panels don't line up, drain tracks are for show, door handle enshitification, etc etc.

Most importantly, we wanted to understand its fuel economy as this is kind of the big argument for these vehicles aside from sports car performance. Rivian advertises between 60-80MPGe for these vehicles. Incredible if true. Our road test found very different numbers. Based on fuel price (charge station near work) it ran ~8MPGe during our ~80 miles of testing. Rerunning the numbers through an EPA formula for MPGe using kwh, they'd call it 10MPGe (the MPGe formula is complete bunk in practice but it happened to give a decent estimate when used in this way). Their claims that we could charge it from a standard wall outlet with the adapter were nonsense as well. We tried, but the truck gave us an infinite time estimate so it at best stabilized things.

The charge process was awful as well. It cost far more than advertised and took 2 hours to charge back 80 miles of use. This led to us running the math and exploring what exactly MPGe is a measure of, as we had a lot of time to kill to think about it. Long and short, speaking as a physicist, it's complete bunk. The EPA estimates MPGe by comparing traveling distance of the EV to that of an ICE vehicle for one gallon of gas using an equivalent amount of energy contained in one gallon of gas for the EV. On the surface, that seems sensible, but it's actually treating the EV as adjacent to a free energy machine as it's purposefully leaving out the entire process of generating the power while factoring that in for the ICE vehicle. If your area isn't backboned by renewables (most of the US) you're actually loosing the majority of this free energy during the generation process that puts it in a usable form for the vehicle. As an example, if your area burns coal as a power source that coal plant is its own ICE that runs comparable efficiency as a car, but burns dirtier fuel and falls behind the efficiency of ICE vehicles as you transport that energy and run it through a charger. For these areas, a real world MPGe estimate is closer to a quarter of the EPA's estimate. If it's winter factor in another 30% loss due to degraded battery function in the cold.

We all came away with roughly the same opinion. Cool vehicle but ""who the hell is this for!?"" It's a fast SUV that's just a people hauler, lacks other capability, gets equivalent fuel economy to a fully loaded semi-truck, charging it away from your home is a nightmare and I'd have to rewire/dedicate an entire portion of my property to charging the thing there (dealer estimated $10-$15k for charger installation).

This is why EVs aren't selling like forecast, especially your high end brands like Tesla, Rivian, etc. They're definitely the future, but the current results don't stack up. In reality, it's pretty clear after driving/measuring one that the hype is just that at best and pushing on outright fraud at worst (I'm looking at you ""MPGe""). Other than some of the smaller economy ones that can kind of argue fuel efficiency, they don't provide a benefit outside of being flashy vroom vroom machines for tech bros that don't care about actual function.

Do you want to spend $125k to get a truck that can barely do truck things, might burn you alive in a 4000¬∞ fire if you bottom out while trying to do truck things and can't find the secondary hidden door handle, gets the fuel economy of a fully loaded semi, has poor assembly tolerance to the point of making it look like a toy, is genuinely difficult to fuel up on the go, and the company has made it pretty clear that they're already lying to you as real world tests fail to reproduce advertised range, fuel economy, etc? No. Nobody wants that.

Perhaps you think it has something to do with the shorter-than-advertised driving range and longer-than-advertised charging time, but no: Rather, the cause of this snag is that the trucks struggle with the basics of stopping and going, by which I mean that the accelerator pedal cover slides off and gets stuck under a panel and locks the accelerator pressed down and keeps the Cybertruck stuck at maximum velocity.*""

*Other Tesla models have had issues with speeding up and slowing down at the wrong times. The company was sued in 2017 by drivers whose cars drove themselves unexpectedly through garages and into walls; a German paper reported last year on over 2,400 complaints about sudden braking problems; and a safety researcher published a white paper showing how voltage spikes could lead Teslas to speed up without warning. You are supposed to like this because it means you are on the cutting edge, helping Elon Musk in his quest to save humanity.""*

In typical Tesla fashion, the layoffs were ruthless and sudden, following hot on Tesla's announcement of its first quarterly sales decline (a drop of 8.5 percent) since the pandemic. Drew Baglino, an executive who'd been around since 2006, and Rohan Patel, a former Obama administration guy hired to help Tesla do corruption and skirt regulation, also announced they would be leaving the company of their own accord. I am tempted here to wonder whether this means Tesla is beginning a meaningful decline‚Äîindeed, the stock is down‚Äîbut the company, which is a stock racket that happens to sell cars, has operated at a level beyond rational analysis for years.*""

Anyone who bought one reportedly had to sign an agreement barring them from selling their Cybertruck within 12 months, or else they would have to pay a $50,000 fine and give Tesla the option to buy it back.""*

Paying 27% more for an electric base model EV truck ($31.5k vs. $39.9k) will still keep the attention of most who could reasonably afford the truck.  Paying $46.9k, changes that to a 49% premium, which is a fuck-off level premium for most consumers.

And the disparity gets worse for higher trim levels: 39.2k vs. 59.5k for the XLT.  49.1k vs. 74.5k for the Lariat....

GMC Hummer EV,"5-60 catches many/most modern turbocharged cars in a dead spot that you will not encounter in any track driving or 99% of street driving. It  is just as bad or even worse single measure of performance than 0-60. 

Much more relevant for the increasingly rare old school slow spooling turbo and small high revving n/a motors.",2022-08-03,reddit
GMC Hummer EV,"5-60 is arguably an arguably worse metric for performance. 

It's a metric that favors regular everyday cars which a) don't have launch control b) don't have much mechanical grip and c) prioritize power and response lower in the RPM range where the car is most usually driven. 

Whether they're NA or FI, most sports cars make their power at higher RPMs (big displacement NA cars notwithstanding). The trade-off is often a lack of torque at lower RPM's, but this is generally a non-issue as most (if not all) performance driving is done at some sort of speed. Remedying this lack of low-end torque is launch control, but for some reason that's silly. 

Has launch control become a way for manufacturers to game 0-60 times? Yes, but 5-60 is no better as a meaningful measurement of performance. When would one need to go full throttle from a walking speed? Not on a track, not at a drag strip, not even on the street would you be in a situation where you need to go from 5-60. If you're doing 5mph willingly, it's because you're stuck in traffic - you're not getting to 60 as quickly as you can in gridlock. 

None of these are ""better reflections of a cars performance"", just go look at lap times and stop the circle jerk over your Rav4 being faster than a Supra.",2022-08-04,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,">The F-150 Lightning is an incredibly important EV for Ford. In Fact, Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, and Executive Chair, Bill Ford, compared the pickup to the 21st-century Model T. It was heralded as the gateway for Ford's EV transition, though adoption has proven slower than anticipated. In fact, the automaker has already scaled back production targets to half of what was originally expected for 2024 and slashed two-thirds of the workforce at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center where the Lightning is assembled.

>Another slap in the face has come directly from Tesla. The F-150 Lightning, despite sales being up 86%, lost its title of best-selling EV pickup to the Cybertruck and the F-Series pickup as a whole is at risk of losing its 42-year crown as best-selling vehicle in America to the Tesla Model Y. Granted, those Cybertruck sales have largely been the fulfillment of years of orders, so it will be several months before we see if it has long-term juice or not. 

>According to data from Cox Automotive cited by Automotive News, Ford has a 100-day supply of F-150s on-hand at the end of September. Generally, dealers want cars on lots for 30-60 days at most. The firm didn't specify a specific estimate for the Lightning, specifically, but did mention a 128-day supply of the Ford E-Transit and a 130-day supply of Mustang Mach-Es.",2024-10-31,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"A short story: some time ago, a wee car called ‚Äòcybersuck‚Äô intrigued the minds of 3 year olds when it was released, as it was reminiscent of something they‚Äôd draw. But just as the car started traipsing the streets having its first moments of joy, the car encountered a touch of moisture and a brown residue formed on its stainable candy shell. Disappointed and mildly confused but undeterred, it decided to have a shot at towing but the bumper ripped off like a fresh scab. This hurt. Most of all he was embarrassed. It looked around at the other cars and decided its DNA must have mutated while it was being conceived. Maybe its creator had been too busy spewing carbon from his Leer while he played video games, or maybe he was too busy helping design Project 2025, or maybe he spent too many days posting vulgarities on X. In any case the cybersuck, chivalrous as you‚Äôd expect it to be, decided driving probably not in his or others‚Äô best interest. So instead he decided to sit for the remainder of his life. Maybe he‚Äôd be lucky enough to encounter a massive flood, fire or mudslide to take away his misery. So he sat in a large boneyard, somehow still lonely among 130 thousand other cyberskeletons. Eventually they all became so forelorn, they decided they would commit mass self-unaliving. So they activated themselves and proceeded with their plan. Several decided to become dumpsters sitting outside HQ. Other dumpsters lit themselves on fire in protest of their creator. There were a few holdouts, however, lighting themselves on fire not to reach the afterlife but rather to stand in solidarity as burning symbols of the fascist Dumpster Fire himself. Eventually, the last few lined up in front of a firing squad and ushered in the shots. Ironically none actually died as they are all ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù, but they did become pockmarked like Martian dirt. These survivors decided as a last ditch effort, to join the next rocket to the Red Planet and donate their bodies as a sheet metal repository. So in the end, they decided being alive was worth it after all.",2025-01-30,reddit

Every time I hear about how a new electric vehicle is the fastest ever I feel like we're celebrating that water is wet.

We get it, electric is great. Low centre of gravity, lots of torque and if you load them to the gills with batteries they go far and can go fast.

Ignoring the weight and price (which is both almost double that of your average vehicle), charging infrastructure is almost never addressed. It's the ugly side of electric vehicles that people don't want to talk about. 

People that can afford $75k trucks will often have driveways or garages to park and charge their vehicles overnight, but many don't have an option to charge at home. With not that many EVs on the road, charging at a supermarket is a valid option for those people now, but that will stop when every other car is electric and they all need to be charged by the handful of chargers at the mall.

A lot of effort is being put into charging cars faster but that doesn't change anything if there's still only a limited amount of electricity being provided by the grid. I'm not talking about the grid being able to generate enough electricity. I'm talking about the wires getting the electricity from the plant to the cars.

Rivian R1T,"Anyone with common sense should be extremely concerned about spending a hundred grand on a Rivian vehicle now. The world is different than when Tesla went through this stage. Rivian is facing unique challenges and there‚Äôs a significant probability this company will fail. The share price is reflecting this risk, and millions of investors are selling their positions. I suppose another company might step in if they fail, but this isn‚Äôt a sure thing. Imagine no software updates, no warranty, impossible to find parts, closed service centres‚Ä¶in 3 years. What will the resale be then? Who do you turn to if the vehicle is bricked when one of their ‚Äúin house‚Äù components fails? Even if they aren‚Äôt bankrupt in 3 years, the depreciation on an R1 purchased today will be horrendous. EV technology (batteries, computers, sensors) is improving so rapidly. I eagerly ordered an R1S Launch Edition in 2019, and only this month am I scheduled to take delivery. Waited 5 years, only to receive a vehicle that is scheduled for a refresh in a couple months. The design and hardware are 5 years old. Up till now, they‚Äôve been delivering all those pre-orders to people like me, who ordered at reduced prices. I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs smart to take delivery at the old, lower price. I really wonder how many people are buying Rivians at current prices. Clearly there‚Äôs a demand problem for R1, which is why they aren‚Äôt ramping up production in 2024. Their factory has capacity to build 4 times as many. I‚Äôll probably cancel my Launch Edition order. Would‚Äôve been cool to receive it 2-3 years ago, but it isn‚Äôt feeling so cool, or smart, in 2024.",2024-03-02,reddit

**To The Moon: GM and Lockheed Martin's New Lunar Rover, Rendered**  
GM is going back to the moon, but this time partnered with Lockheed Martin for ""moon buggies.""

[https://www.motortrend.com/news/gm-design-lockheed-martin-new-lunar-rover-renderings/](https://www.motortrend.com/news/gm-design-lockheed-martin-new-lunar-rover-renderings/)

According to GM back in May of 2021, these next-generation lunar rover vehicles are being designed to drive even farther distances to support the first excursions of the Moon's south pole. These new LRVs will also need better technology beyond their capacities as the south pole is **dark, making it much colder** with much more rugged terrain and the sunlit surfaces the Apollo missions landed in.  
Fortunately, **GM's Ultium technologies will most likely help create the drive and battery packs** these new rovers need. These new rovers will also be **autonomous**, allowing them to launch prior to the human landings. This is needed to help prepare for ""commercial payload services and enhance the range and utility of scientific payloads and experiments"" according to GM.

AVL is billed as an industry leader for the development, simulation, and testing of vehicle systems and will be used for its expertise in the advancement of battery electric vehicles, autonomous driving, and propulsion solutions. Intuitive Machines and their Nova-D spacecraft will be used to bring the LTV to the Moon using four liquid methane/oxygen engines from their Nova-C program. Lunar Outpost‚Äîa leader in lunar mobility platforms according to Northrop‚Äîwill leverage its **dust mitigation and thermal technologies from the development of its MAPP rover to help develop similar solutions for the LTV.**",2023-06-29,reddit

Shared stuff with Rivian, shared stuff with VW, Ford's battery supplier penalized for some sort of IP infringement. Unless Ford announces something real big, or the rivian products are crazy good, I don't have any confidence in Ford to pull off an EV portfolio as big as it's planning.

These are different platforms, and the comparison to a lambo doesn't matter.  The weight of the vehicle, power to weight ratio, the center of gravity, amount of body roll, braking power, steering responsiveness are all completely different.  I have yet to drive an EV that feels as light and playful as a Miata.

Steer-by-wire - Amazing, allows for infinitely configurable steering, everyone will go down this path, hope Rivian is one of the first to follow.

48V - Rivian should do it too ASAP.

Cross car wiring - Amazing advancement. Normally cars have wires going from front to back and side to side, a wire for each electrical component from cameras to speakers. Tesla will just have one Ethernet cable (like your network cable at home) to transfer data across the car.

The batteries - One of the reviews showed how the launches were so consistent, it seems like they don‚Äôt overheat. If you follow out of spec, it seems like Rivian keeps overheating towing long distances; if Tesla doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs a massive bonus.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"As someone who works at a Ford dealer and has some inside knowledge, let me tell you, we are not even quite there yet on who gets their Lightning. The reservation conversions to orders will be coming in 'waves'. You will be notified directly by Ford if you are selected for the first wave. The dealer will then be able to see who has been selected to convert to an order once the notifications from Ford have gone to the reservation holders. There is no guarantee you're even getting one. I was 2nd in line (by 19 seconds) at my dealership in the reservation queue. If you have  under 50 reservations, the dealer gets to 'prioritize' 5 people. 51-100 is 10 priorities. We're at 49 due to a few cancellations, but I'm luckily one of those people. From the verbage of the release to us by Ford, even being prioritized might not guarantee someone is an owner in the first year. All reservations not selected will of course be able to hold their reservations to the next model year.

Tesla Cybertruck,"Being a person that drove a 4 person coupe with 2 doors and 4WD and more power than needed I can understand people buying impractical and rather useless cars for anything else than being a means of transportation in a fun way. 

The thing with the Cybertruck is that it‚Äôs sold as a practical useful car, while none of those features have been implemented properly. There are plenty of other cars that fall into the category of rather useless for practical purposes but nice to drive. 

The fun part comes when people buy them and go convince others that their impractical car is actually more useful than all others. I think the owners should just stay in their category and enjoy their impractical peace of toy. Nothing wrong with that.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Compared to Tesla's offering (Cybertruck):

Ford: 

* Ford wins on build quality so far from what I've seen. I trust the truck won't literally fall apart.
* Ford wins on affordability so far--- and availability. You can roll down to a dealer in a major area and get a Lightning, not so much with a Cyberdumpster.
* Ford wins on interior cabin space.
* Ford wins on standard bed shape (you can use a truck box, standard camper shell bed cover, etc.).

Tesla:

* Tesla wins on fast-charging. (It literally charges faster.)
* Tesla wins on charging network (though Ford has access to lots of stations now if you get an adapter-- so not a big deal imho).
* Tesla wins on software. (Ford's software is... eh... it's not unuseable but it's a far cry from the stuff Tesla and Kia have put out. Ford is getting there, but slowly.)",2024-09-18,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Consider everything a pro except:

1. Towing for distance. I tow a pontoon boat regularly, but it's 10 miles to the lake and zero range concerns.  However, picking it up when I bought it 100 miles away was a bit of a pain.  Basically, I had to charge twice, making the trip an hour longer.

2. Long road trips. I recently did 600 miles one way, and it took a good 2 hours longer than it would have with gas. It's a 12 hour drive regularly, 14 with charging.  However, it's the first 14-hour road trip that I managed to get 10,000 steps in! (I walk when I charge).

3. Cold weather performance. I won't talk about this much as I live in the southeast US. But know that range will be a lot less driving in cold temps.

4. Offload performance. I think the tire options say it all...

EVERYTHING else is a pro imo.  I have more payload than regular F150s.  It's faster, cheaper, quieter, easier to maintain, and if you have any diy ability and a big enough yard, you can charge with solar!",2024-09-18,reddit

When ram was still promising the longer range, and with Silverado having it, and before the cyber truck launched and proved that their range was much lower, I always figured that market pressures were forced forward into the longer range. But realistically, looking at current available trucks on the market, both current and planned, I don't think they really need to do it from a market pressure perspective anymore.",2025-01-23,reddit

Too small, to hard to get in and out of, poor visibility and front wheel drive blows.

My Diesel pickups get used a lot. My 2006 is a dailer beater with almost 325k on her, and I have a 2019 Dually. When I tow, it's often from TX to MN or WI. Last summer I took the trust old 2006 to NC to retrieve a vintage snowmobile and the following weekend I towed a flat 23' trailer to MN for a snowmobile swap meet, totalling 4,500 miles together.

Who cares if I haul fire wood, (I do) or brush or scrap metal. I like the 2006. It's comfortable and the last manual transmission pickup GM built.

Rivian R1T,"Definitely pull the trigger, 2022 owner here, best vehicle I've ever driven.

1. They should be fine.  While I personally have the 20"" on my R1T, I have the Pirelli AS on my MDX (21"" equivalent tire), and they are very capable on plowed roads, just be sure to carry appropriate snow traction chains/cables/socks.
2. R1T drives great.  Good turn radius, easy to park with the 360 birds eye cameras.  Surprisingly nimble for a vehicle this large, though it is smaller and significantly easier to park than a full size truck.  Worst case may have to back into spots more.  Coming from sedans it will be a learning curve, but you'll love the overall feel and visibility from the R1T
3. I also have two kids and a beagle.  Car seats and booster seats work perfect in the back seat.  Perfect vehicle for family of 4, though would be tight with 5.  I do however recommend getting steps or rock sliders, made getting into the vehicle signiifcantly easier for everyone (even when in LOW suspension).
4. Driver+ is great for what it is on Gen 1: Freeway adaptive cruise (even in stop and go) with automatic lane centering & steering.  It's almost hands-free freeway driving.  Adaptive cruise works on city streets, but not lane centering.
5. if you're buying used, I would just make sure there is still 2 years and 20k miles left on the warranty, this way if the original owner didn't fix any issues, the warranty will cover it.  Getting a service center appointment can be a pain, but Rivian will generally take care of any issues no problem and no cost while under warranty.

Edit: Also, with kids that small, don't be afraid to put some corner guards on the gear tunnel door.  Depending on how early VIN you get, the edges on early VIN gear tunnel doors could be sharp.  I ended up putting some edge protectors on mine, which also saved my shins and knees as well.",2025-02-12,reddit

Yes, LED's are a little more efficient and offer a little better lighting, but when a headlamp costs $1,000USD+ on a 2022 Corolla whereas they were about $200USD in 2002, you can keep your efficiency and power and I'll keep my cheap halogens.",2022-10-13,reddit

* $100k and the rear view mirror isn't a camera? With the cover closed, the RVM is just an ornament and I'm sure was added just to make regulators happy. There are $35k cars that have rear view cameras. 
* You'll be lucky if you get 300 miles of range. The Silverado gets nearly 500 miles. You have to pay $16k more to get the 400+ mile range extender and lose a third of your bed space

There are EV trucks that go farther, and tow heavier. It really only competes with other EV trucks on payload. You can get almost all of them for less money too, especially with current dealer perks. 

The bed is a product of form over function, and its efficiency rating doesn't even really exceed that of competing trucks. It doesn't win the turn radius test of EV trucks (it does get close). Steer by wire is impressive, but I think not enough for most. 

Now throw all of the political influence of Musk in (agree or disagree that this is a ""problem"", it's effecting people's buying decisions), and you have a product that has become unattractive for a lot of people.

* Weekend warriors: People who may need to tow their boat twice a year or occasionally do home improvement (even though the math works out the just paying someone else to deliver / tow those few times a year + buying a more economical vehicle is usually the better option)

Entire reservation list = only the subset of the list for those in the US for the regular series and other parts of North America for Foundation.

When did the standard 2024 F150 exhaust it's reservation list? Obviously nobody wants that?

Can someone remind me how many vehicles started production in 2023 or earlier and still have a reservation list? Maybe the Tesla Semi? The list of cars that ""nobody wants"" must include every car without a reservation list? If you include cars that aren't yet in production then you can add the R2S and Aptera and I'm sure a few supercars.

If the foundation series is anything to go by, Tesla is manufacturing the Cybertrucks in various configurations and releasing the invites to make sure everything that they have produced is sold. So there is probably some combination of options where they have produced sufficient to meet demand, but most who are configuring today will still need to wait a while.

TBH the comparison with a house seems to me like either anti-EV or anti-Hummer rhetoric. Numbers in a vacuum + trigger bait description. Let's see how a gasoline engine stacks up. A wimply li'l Honda Civic has a 180 horsepower engine. This is equivalent to 135kw (1hp = 750w). Driving it 50 miles at 55mph takes a little over an hour, so is that 135 kwh, or more than 4x what a house uses in a day?

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Ford's order banks are open for the 2024 model year Lightnings, so Ford is offering discounts clear any remaining 2023 trucks off of dealer lots.  Dealers may of course set any selling price they want, but most will honor Ford's discounts.  This is a normal end-of-model-year process for traditional US carmakers. 

We didn't see this last year because: the 2022 and 2023 Lightnings are practically identical aside from chip-related feature deletions; so few 2022 Lightnings were produced; and demand for the Lightning was strong enough that very few 2022s were sitting on dealer lots when the 2023 trucks started shipping.

There are some noticeable changes for the 2024 Lightnings:

* All 2024 Lightnings have a heat pump for better cold-weather range.
* Battery size is now based on trim level:
   * Pro and XLT trucks are now standard-range (98kWh) battery; and 
   * Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trucks are extended-range (131kWh) battery.
* Flash is a new trim level that effectively replaces an extended-range XLT truck; there is nothing comparable to a standard-range Lariat in the 2024 line-up.
* BlueCruise is now a 90-day trial followed by a subscription.
* Changes to Level 2 charging for extended-range trucks:
   * Maximum Level 2 charge acceptance rate is 11.5kW via a single on-board charger (down from 19.2kW from dual on-board chargers in the 2022-2023 trucks).
   * Ford Charge Station Pro is no longer included with purchase.
* While all 2024 Lightnings will initially use NMC batteries, at some point later in the model year, the standard-range trucks will switch to an LFP chemistry.  There probably won't be any cost or range differences when that happens.",2023-10-12,reddit

Rivian R1T,"From motorlinks: 

""Last fall the company abruptly terminated Laura Schwab, who was lured away from Aston Martin to head Rivian‚Äôs sales and marketing.

Schwab, in a lawsuit against the company, said one reason she was fired is because she questioned Rivian‚Äôs pricing. The R1T electric truck‚Äôs starting sticker price of $67,500 was too low, Schwab said in her suit. Rivian was on the cusp of launching its IPO and had already booked thousands of orders for its pickup.

Her suit says: ‚ÄúFirst, it was clear that the vehicles were underpriced, and each sale would result in a loss the company. Ms. Schwab ultimately contacted Dennis Lucey, Rivian‚Äôs Finance Director, and worked with him to develop pr1ojections showing how much of a loss the company would incur if Rivian did not raise prices. Ms. Schwab raised this issue with several executives, including Mr. Behl, Stuart Dixon (Director of Product Management), and Andy Zicheck (Principal Product Manager).

Tesla Cybertruck,"Funny how quickly articles go from tesla specific to EV hitpiece. 

I think the 3 issues are it's looks and the politics/elon's influence on the design, and the typical tesla initial build quality. Everything else people complain about(price, range, charging, towing, off roading, safety) is either debatable or exactly the same with other evs and especially ev trucks. If they fixed every single one of those issues people would still not buy them for reasons 1 and 2. 

 I really don't like the ""not a real truck"" argument for all ev trucks. People use trucks for other things than distance towing. I would love a bed so to not hook up my trailer every time I need a Home depot or furniture store run. The other trucks might be better or worse than the CT but they aren't selling either for the same  ""not a real truck"" reason

Amazon also ordered another 100,000 EVs, and they‚Äôve re-did their contract with Amazon which allows them to sell to other commercial fleets. They‚Äôre in talks with new ones now, and think they‚Äôll start seeing orders in 2025. 

Time will tell how much the R2 will cost, and what the demand will be. But imo they‚Äôre on a good trajectory. All things considered, I think 2025 is gonna be a turn around year",2024-03-03,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Having done several uneventful 1000+ mile trips in a Lightning (and not the long range version from the article), the article illustrates the 3 main outcomes of EV trips, right now:

1) The first half of the author‚Äôs trip: If you entrust your trip planning to the Lightning‚Äôs navigation and the Electrify America app alone? Good luck. You‚Äôre going to take a stupid route, with unnecessary stops at slow chargers, or even worse, be routed to chargers that are offline. 

2) The second half of the author‚Äôs trip: If you take responsibility for planning the route and use apps like PlugShare, where other drivers post reviews of charging stations, being flexible even en route to make changes to the plan, you‚Äôre probably going to have a good trip. Like I said, I‚Äôve done four 1,000+ mile trips in mine in the last year, including a 1,400 mile trip starting in 15*F weather in Iowa.

EA is incompetent and Ford‚Äôs nav software is downright bad.

Everyone will be in MUCH better shape when they have access to Tesla Superchargers this spring, as noted by the 98 Superchargers that were at the site of the article‚Äôs charging debacle, which leads to outcome #3.

3.  As someone who has also done several long trips in a Tesla, it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. I‚Äôd head out on a long trip in a Tesla with nothing but the built-in Nav telling me what to do and not worry at all.

 - Improved interior comfort: the Lightning rear row is a little bumpy for backseat passenger
 - Needs changing. Ultimately we realized we no longer do as many truck things as we once did and now we‚Äôd rather be able to fit our guests plus dog into one vehicle when they visit.

Tesla Cybertruck,"Hot take I find myself really apathetic to this. I don't agree with enabling flippers/markups like how C&B does. However no one NEEDS a cyber truck. And at 100k MSRP, it's already so far out of reach of the average person. If you want it so badly and need the latest greatest thing, sure go ahead and pay 50k over. But if you're looking for one as a frivolous purchase (as I'm sure many cybertrucks will be) you can wait for the market to settle. No one is making you pay the markup. If people want to spend extra money to be impatient so be it. 

To be clear I am just as jaded to the constant markups we are seeing on enthusiast products and find it scummy. I want a Type R but I'm adamant on waiting for prices to settle a bit. Maybe this is how I cope lol",2024-03-22,reddit

It's full of neat engineering with the usual Tesla build quality issues and some funky design that sometimes gets in the way of functionality.

Why this thing is so polarizing is beyond me - I think some of that might be limited to the terminally online crowd but its hard to tell. Most of my real-life friends and family think it's interesting and don't hate it, but aren't going to buy one.

I think the Silverado/Sierra EV is gonna be best a truck stuff with its huge battery, the Rivian is the coolest, and the Lightning has the advantages of being a normal truck. But the Cybertruck is something different and new, which has an appeal.",2024-10-14,reddit

If anything, it has the effect of hurting resale prices so if you have a Tesla already and want to trade it in for a new one the tax credits hurt the trade in value but you don‚Äôt get the benefit on the purchase so you‚Äôre worse off",2025-03-21,reddit

Overall I like the R1T much better, but of course there are things I liked better about the Tesla too. The Tesla felt more like a toy to me, which is probably a plus for some, but not for me. The Riviain just feels more well built and premium. The automatic frunk is really a game changer too. The Tesla charging network is obviously a big plus for Tesla (although I can use my Rivian at most). The autopilot is also eons better in the Tesla and I'm actually surprised at how poor it is on my Rivian (my wife's Toyota's is actually better). They're working on that with the Gen 2 Rivians, though.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I am a top 10% earner in the US. I don‚Äôt say that to brag. I live in a big CoL area, but I make do with budgeting.

I can‚Äôt afford a F150 Lightning.

60k is half my take home. That‚Äôs a full year of tuition at a good college. Assuming we‚Äôre using 100$/week groceries for 4, that‚Äôs roughly 11 years of groceries. Thats half a down payment for a mortgage.

And that‚Äôs just base MSRP for the cheapest offering with absolutely no additional features. Go to a dealer and everyone of those vultures are adding useless features for insane markup, I‚Äôm talking I can‚Äôt buy a lighting in my area for any less than 80k. AND add in interest from an above average rate from my above average credit score, I‚Äôm in the hole for 100k over the life of the car, whose maintenance best practices (and cost) is wholly unknown.

Who‚Äôs the market for this?

I mean ‚Äútechnically‚Äù I could afford it with a car loan. But I already have a paid off car, how does a 100k luxury expense when I could use that money for a non-depreciating asset or necessities make any fucking sense?

If I‚Äôm going to drop 6 figures on a car, it‚Äôs going to be on a restored 69 Mach 1 mustang. Not some battery powered toy whose place in the market is to be thrown away after 5 years.

  
Some of Y'all reading weird shit into my comment. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings if you bought an F150 lighting or want to buy one. A 69 mustang is just as dumb of a financial purchase.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I check up on the used F150 Lightning market from time to time to see if the EV doom & gloom has depressed it enough to spark my interest and what's weird is that all the ones for sale are always super low miles, like a few hundred to a few thousand miles for a 2023 and only a few more miles for a 2022. Nobody is trading in their 10~15k mile/year trucks... I guess those people like them.

It is mind boggling when you start figuring what these truck's original owners paid to hardly drive the thing for a year or two. Don't forget to figure in insurance and maybe a 240v charger install too but that's probably a rounding error compared to the depreciation, especially if they bought it at the peak of dealer markups.

Rivian R1T,"I completetely agree with that statement.

The cybertruck is something completely different and is not going to complete with any truck buyers.

There is a historical proof of this if you look back to the orginal honda Ridgeline which at the time on paper was a great midsize truck and beat others by a long shot. It had a weird look and some odd things. They found out quickly very little overlap.  Hence why the new ridgeline looks like a fing truck.

The R1T does not really even directly complete with the F150 as it is mid size truck vs a full size.

Tesla Cybertruck,"I don't hate it. It has some awkward angles for sure but overall I don't find it repulsive like so many seem to. 

I think its main problems are the usual Tesla production quality issues (sharp unfinished edges, poor panel alignment/attachment) and poor value for the price. 

If the thing were built a little bit better and actually available for $40-$50k with reasonable specs it would probably be less controversial.

A lot of the negative talking points (dangerous to pedestrians, warranty doesn't cover car wash damage) apply to plenty of other vehicles as well. The US doesn't have formalized pedestrian safety testing or standards and most full-size trucks and SUVs would likely perform poorly in such tests.

I think another issue that will come up long-term is the sameness of having all the produced trucks be the exact same color and finish. At $80-$100k at least some of the purchase price has to be going to having something cool, unique, 'bad-ass', or however the purchaser happens to feel to justify it.

It was like the Nicholas Cage of trucks, it's either incredible or terrible.

Then we all kind of came around to the truth of Elon. I know that I totally forgot about the Cyber Truck in the interim, and then one day they started delivering them.

But now that he's reached his final charlatan form, the rose colored glasses have come off and what once were quirks are now recognized as flaws.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I hate this new trend of announcing vehicles at superficially low prices.



Seems they always either 

-announce at a low *low* price when the release is far off into the future, so manufacturers coast for months or years on consumer & media hype about a dope vehicle at an insane price, then drop the price increase hammer at the last minute after reaping tons of free buzz & publicity. 

or

-they announce at a good price and begin selling right away but every single year the price goes up at least a grand or more until they get the price where they always actually wanted it plus almost everything is an option.

or 

-they actually do keep to their ridiculously good announced starting price but that's because they only intend on selling you a powertrain & roling shell and *literally everything* is in option or package and you *need* at least 2-3 options *and* packages to actually get the car you want and now the price has gone up *at least* 20%

then, cherry on top

-still have mark-ups, add-ons, & fees to look out for.

I will wait to make my decision till TFL or Car throttle get it and we get to see less rose colored reviews.

My reasons, CT is closer to M3 in interior... Not a good thing.
CT Cyberbeast is 99k and what I would need to get to replace the Rivian, I got my Rivian pre price hike at 78k. And could replace it today for 86. 13k is a lot.

This is the first hummer in 15 years that isn't just a massive douche yacht, it actually has real off-road capability, speed, cool features, etc.

I've seen 2 hummer evs so far and each time it's brought a big-ass smile to my face because it's just so crazy. Yeah, there are probably gonna be some idiots who buy one and never use it other than flexing, but at least with this hummer they could back it up if they needed to. The previous 2 models were owned exclusively by dickbags because they were needlessly excessive, but not good in any way.

My wife walks in and sees him on screen and rolls her eyes with a ""hello Kyle"" remark.  I haven't watched this one yet, but normally I wouldn't care much about fast charging speed, except I'm rapidly approaching a use-case scenario where this becomes more important to me.  We have a kid in travel soccer and our eTron is essentially useless on trips past 200 miles because (a) the range sucks, and (b) Electrify America is a shit show.  We've gotten around this by either taking my Model S (not ideal because the kid alone has like 3-4 bags on these trips) or the kid's Tiguan.  Now that she's committed to playing soccer in college, we are looking at a roughly 320 mile one-way drive to see her home games.  On what is about a 5-hour drive, I don't want charging to take a minute longer than it has to.  If charging is going to add another hour to that drive, we're on a plane vs. being able to drive and bring stuff with us for the kid, or potentially work on an investment property if we decide to buy something near her school. Interesting strategies by manufacturers.  An Audi senior years ago all but admitted that they don't care about range.  They think it's overrated as a concern for buyers and apparently saw nothing wrong charging $90k for an eTron that can barely get 200 miles on a cold afternoon.  That might be one of the reasons why reports are suggesting they've suspending production of the Q8 eTron.  Rivian seems to care about range, but not so much your ability to charge the car quickly.

One of the main benefits of a truck is towing capacity. And towing anything destroys range. Sure they may have amazing torque, which is great if you need to take the boat 10 miles to the nearby lake. But anything long distance just doesn't work.

EV's make so much sense for commuter cars. But much less for trucks. I think auto manufacturers just got mesmerized by the enormous margins they earn on ICE trucks and convinced themselves it was a good idea.",2025-02-05,reddit

And the audio system definitely needed quite a bit of EQ adjustment for me to get it right for my preference. 

That said, he did try to add some positives at the end that I think need to be highlighted. The R1T balances its size, storage, and overall driving performance better than almost any vehicle on the road, regardless of EV or ICE. This is a lifestyle vehicle, so there are some compromises to be made but at the end of the day, Rivian does a lot right and it‚Äôs still my favorite vehicle I‚Äôve ever owned.

We are in the EV infancy stage and the pace of innovation will be blazing fast, so Rivian does need to make sure it keeps up with all of the new vehicles that have come out since R1 platform was released.

Steer by wire is probably the most underrated/under-appreciated thing, combined with the rear wheel steering, driving a car with traditional steering feels weird now. The nimbleness of the steering and the cameras/software has made transitioning from my much smaller Jeep Cherokee surprisingly easy. People give it crap for being unnecessarily big, but it‚Äôs actually the lightest EV pickup sold in the US (that I know of) and has a big bed, and a ton of interior space.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I mean, this is impressive and will sell well in certain markets. But for anyone I know who owns trucks, this definitely won't work with a 300 mile range max. Especially when towing is considered, which I assume will drop the range drastically. Even if towing only drops it to 200 miles, I know people who have cabins or places they stay that is further than that from their main homes. Or who take yearly roadtrips to Florida or Tennessee with their trucks (I live in Michigan). They take their trucks and trailers/toys/boats to the Upper Peninsula which is 200-500 miles depending on where you live in Michigan and where you are going in the UP. So people would need a 2nd truck which would go against the ideas of an eco truck for all around use.

Regardless, these are impressive numbers for a commercial truck. I am surprised they managed to get this range. There must be a lot of batteries. I also imagine by 2023 they will have a King Ranch or equivalent trim level with a slightly higher range? Maybe 350-400?",2021-05-20,reddit

If you don‚Äôt tow and primarily use it as a commuter vehicle, then it seems like you‚Äôre going to have a better time with an enclosed Rivian R1S or Kia EV9 or something like that.

It could be the perfect work truck if you don‚Äôt tow and primarily just drive around town a good amount throughout your day - it could contribute to considerable savings on gasoline and in long term reliability.

Rivian R1T,"I pushed my deal through quickly as well. Little different scenario as I picked a '24 out of the store as they were coming available for the $6k F&F discount. clicked ""buy"" on Thursday morning. Took Delivery Monday evening. Fastest and easiest transaction for a vehicle in my 27+yrs of driving. Even with the hiccups along the way.

No real document errors, but lots of back and forth on the trade in ('17 Q7) to get my existing bank to get details sorted. Then a lot of back and forth to get the agreements signed. Several ""little"" errors like yours, namely a couple of inputs like address and zip code that were clearly ""fat fingered"" or had digits reversed. You could tell the people putting the paperwork together were rushed. Also got the ""If you don't sign the agreement today you'll lose your discounts"" text message with nothing remaining to sign. Got the email with my agreement about 2hrs later, and signed it within minutes. 

Delivery wasn't quite as great. I left my garage door opener and house keys in my trade. Rivian team overnighted them back to me (I was 3.5hrs from delivery site), so that was awesome. Didn't get to ""test drive"" the truck before signing papers. Kind of wish I would have as I now have a service appointment for next week to address suspension clunking issue and a significant vibration around 50mph. 

Overall though, still has to be one of the easiest vehicle purchases I've ever made. Didn't have to do the stupid ""song and dance"" BS with a salesperson and a finance manager and all that crap that comes with the dealership experience of other brands. My initial test drive was in Toronto, and there was ZERO finance talk during that visit, just a dude at the service center that was genuinely enthused about the trucks and was there to show us around. Same with the delivery day, that guy (Chris in Cleveland) was just happy to be there and to answer questions. Customer service has been great this week, and every interaction I've had with a Rivian employee has been positive, even when working through issues or problems (albeit minor at this point).

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I put a launch day deposit down on a Lariat at what I believe was the $60k price point.  When it was delivered to the dealership, the sticker was $92k with zero incentives.  It was supposed to be a 2022 model at launch pricing, but they made nearly none of those and then jacked up the price on the 2023 models although I was previously told by the dealership I'd still be able to get the launch pricing.  I subsequently refused delivery, and then the sales manager accused me of ""vanity ordering"" with the intention of not taking delivery - probably because I showed up in my old grubby around the house work clothes instead of something more dressy.  Then they sold it for over $100k because it was one of the first Lightnings on the lot.  I vowed to never set foot in that dealership again.

Now the Silverado is here, and it's in every way a better vehicle.  Designed from day one as an EV, with no gas vehicle carryover platform compromises.  492 miles on the Silverado with the max range battery compared to 300 on the F-150.  That's an ass-whooping, son.

Ford needs a complete ground-up redesign and put a realistic sticker price on it, like yesterday.  I don't feel one bit sorry for them.

1. It's a massive vehicle and I came from a Chevy Tahoe. Turning radius is like tell zip codes, getting into parking spots isn't easy

2. It's not very efficient compared to other EV's, but then again there isn't many land yacht EVs like this. In the winter it takes more finesse to do road trips, I'm seeing a range down to 150-160 miles even when I limit cabin temp and fan speed

3. Suspension is way too soft which is nice for on road but even then sometimes it feels bouncy. Off road it becomes a problem

4. Towing a camping trailer on standard range is 90 miles if you want to risk getting to 10% soc. It's manageable but if you're towing once a month or more, longer than 180 miles one way than I don't recommend this truck. I figure 180 miles one way is manageable as you'll do only 1 stop but other than that it's cumbersome. We only camp maybe 5 times per year so this seems like an acceptable trade off for being a great commuter. The trips greater them 90 miles one way we stop an ea at a Walmart and get groceries while it's charging so it's not much of an inconvenience stopping",2023-12-03,reddit

I'm not saying that launch control isn't gimmicky, moreso that 5-60 is even less representative of typical driving. Not to mention it's literally a worse case scenario for a big turbo small engine cars like mine especially if you're not still in first gear. 

It seems like it's just hunting for a harder metric for turbo cars when many of them do a pretty good job hiding turbo lag these days under actual normal usage scenarios, especially when ECU + TCU tuned. I'd argue 0-60 no rollout with launch control off, 30-50, 50-70 and 60-130 are all more useful ""real world"" metrics than 5-60.

On the other hand, I think the packaging is superior to traditionally styled trucks in a lot of ways, particularly the shorter and steeper front that gives superior forward visibility. And it is apparently a joy to drive, with enormous torque, cool steering tricks and a very comfortable interior.

Rivian R1T,"I think the big 3 still will come out with the best option here at some point.  Tesla has the price right but that design is one only a mother (or father in this case) could love.  Rivian has the looks/features right but the price is up there.  

Obviously pickups get up to $80k when you buy the most expensive one but I‚Äôd say most are only willing to stretch their 84 month payment plans to a $50k truck.      

Maybe the hope is that people who have money and want practicality but are turned off by the fuel waste of pickups will move to Rivian?  I love it and feel like I‚Äôm one of those people but seeing the Cybertruck pricing makes me rethink the value of Rivian.

Chevy Silverado EV,"I think the biggest news with this truck is the death of frame on rails.

One of the major manufacturers of the 1/2 ton truck is now making a unibody truck. That means the next generation Ford will have to decide if it is frame on rails or unibody. I suspect that they will go unibody. 

Just a note, the maverick is unibody. And it gets great mpg and it is cheap. The Cybertruck and Rivian are unibody as well. The lightning and ram seem to be the only frame on rails truck left. Who knows what the new Silverado will be, but I'm guessing this is a huge indication that the new Silverado will be unibody as well. 

That's a MASSIVE change in the truck world. It means the trucks will be less modular and more efficient. They'll also drive more like cars and handle better. I honestly don't think there is a major downside with going away from the frame other than manufacturing is more expensive if you want to have different layouts.",2022-01-05,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I think the price alone is my biggest takeaway. The price is very good starting out. $40k before tax incentives? Yup, not bad. Then factor in people who love the brand and want a truck, $32/$35k looks very good to those consumers. 

I‚Äôm not too concerned with the range, let‚Äôs be honest here, average folks with trucks aren‚Äôt going long distances every day and they sure aren‚Äôt hauling heavy loads around daily either. The range will be just fine. 

Big picture tho, this is a shot at Tesla point blank. Ford came with it, next up GM, then Honda,Toyota, Volkswagen ID.4 and others who are coming guns blazing. The pie is about to be cut up and I don‚Äôt think within the next 2/3 years Tesla will have those expensive prices around for much longer. The hype will die down. Seems like it already is in a sense.

Tesla is a luxury brand, and I wanna say that‚Äôs less than the 5% of people in a certain price range that buys them. You get these EV‚Äôs/Trucks around $20/$35k out the door, they‚Äôll sell like hot cakes.",2021-05-20,reddit

I don't like the misleading stuff tesla pulled by announcing a concept car with concept specs & taking reservations while it was nowhere near ready for production. My father had one reserved for funsies but refunded his reservation years ago because Elon went so completely off the rails. 

I do like how it looks tbh, but the construction method seems like a miss and it's kinda expensive. The impressive parts of the truck are undermined by the years of absurd promises about its capabilities and specs.

I find it such an intriguing vehicle and I love seeing them around. The 48v architecture, 4-wheel steering, Steer by wire, and Ethernet wiring are all things that I like for the future of cars in general. The technology behind the vehicle is amazing to me and that makes it more attractive. But I came to the conclusion that with the lower range and same number of seats as my Model Y it was basically a huge version of my Model Y functionally but with a truck bed. That wasn‚Äôt worth $100k for me. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth $80k to me either. Even if it just had the 500 mile range that was promised I would pull the trigger.

It arrived and it looks pretty much exactly like its concept, which I actually don't hate.  But it didn't deliver the 500 miles, and it certainly didn't deliver its proposed price range.

Throw in Musk's erratic and unpredictable management, his full embrace of wannabe 4chan memelord persona, the neverending FSD edging, and insurers getting flaky about covering it, and it's just too much weirdness in one package.

I saw them on the lot and asked for someone who knew about the pickups.   Once I had a sales guy there, I specifically asked about the Lightning.

The sales guy looked annoyed and tried to tell me details on the new Ecoboost engine.

I told him I was certain what I was looking for and he shrugged and said ""I don't know a thing about those, wait here"".

I sat for about 10 minutes before going up to the sales desk to ask what's going on.  I told them someone had gone to find info on the Lightning and he looked confused.  Said ""some of the sales guys have gone home for the day"".

I'm guessing the guy I talked to lazily told someone to deal with it and then left for the day (it was early evening).

Regardless, I found someone to talk to me and he took me out the trucks.  I asked him about range and he quoted the extended range miles, but he was pointing at standard range trucks.  I asked him if these had that range and he said ""yep"".  I looked at the window sticker and pointed out the different number.  He shrugged and said ""oh ok, I guess maybe these are the older model"".

At that point, I told him I'd look around and let him know if I needed anything and just resorted to reading window stickers.

In the end, people aren't going to be carving up canyons in these things.  And if other Tesla models have taught us anything, once they see their range plunge, they won't be launching very hard all that often either.

Meanwhile GM cancels one the more popular EVs that aren't a Tesla and has a loyal customer case just as their sales are showing year over year growth. Then they are surprised people are upset and announce the Bolt is coming back.

Then they allow a strike to go on costing them significant amounts of money only to give up ground. Concessions which were fairly obviously going to be given up because from the onset almost no one outside of  themselves sided with their point of view.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I'll be honest, I really can't think of a negative thing to say about either my Lightning Lariat or XLT. I've driven from FL to NJ in the winter, towed, loaded, camped, etc., etc. That is not to say there aren't limits or things I would change/upgrade, but I've tempered my expectations and additionally have been a lifelong Ford truck owner.

The only ""con"" I can think of to relate to your situation would possibly be towing and ONLY because you would be coming from an F-350. I am in no way saying it can't tow, just that I wouldn't probably own one if I was a frequent long-distance driver who tows heavy because of the inherent inconveniences you would probably encounter. With my standard range battery rated for 240 miles at 100%, I have towed a friend's 2023 F-150 Lariat (\~5100 lbs) and saw a range of 168 miles; the truck immediately calculates the distance as soon as the trailer or payload is on and input into the onboard tow feature and we didn't need to go that whole distance but the miles per kWh equated to the rate necessary for 168 miles, so I'd say the truck is accurately calculating.

To preface this next part, I have owned a Tesla Model 3 between my Lightning ownerships. To answer your Cybertruck question, while I do firmly believe that truck will go down as iconic based on appearance and engineering involved to design such a vehicle, I would also tell you that in comparison to the F-150 Lightning it has many stark differences. Whereas the Lightning feels like a truck by all conventional measures inside and out, the Cybertruck does not; obviously the outside but equally so on the inside and in the way the driver operates and integrates with the vehicle. I have a friend who owns a Cybertruck and truly uses it as a truck as much as one typically expects, such as hauling mulch, rocks and various other home-project related materials as well as his bass boat and jet skis. So to say it can be the truck it's intended to be (without resorting to YouTube-level extreme stunts), it can but... the polarizing design is what you have to commit to owning and answering for.",2024-09-20,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"I'm in the North Bay. Had Fords growing up. I ordered back in 2019 and didn't hesitate to order the foundation series. I know the design is weird AF but I was incredibly fed up with Ford and their shady business practices. At the time, my wife had a model X. It rarely needed service and Tesla was able to fix some issues remotely. Meanwhile, my Ford needed a $5000 transmission rebuild in less than 100K miles and needed a $9000+ engine rebuild shortly after that. Tesla doesn't want their cars in for service and doesn't rely on a service model. So when the Cybertruck was announced, I knew I was in.

I love the truck and use it for truck things. I can't see having a use for it in a dense city setting. The only negative I have is the towing range. But... When I compare it with my old 2006 Ford (which got 8mpg towing), the Cybertruck loses the exact same amount of range.

Chevy Silverado EV,"I'm of the opinion that for a large majority of people, the 300-350 range is plenty. Not saying there aren't edge cases, but rather that the people who say they aren't getting an EV until they can get 400-500 miles of range are either just using it as an excuse to not get an EV or are unrealistic as hell. Don't know if we will ever see that much range on EV sedans unless battery energy density goes up and prices come down. And even if that happens, faster charging would make more range unnecessary. So it may never happen. 

That said, pickup trucks are different. 350 miles of range can be half that while towing so up to 600 would be welcome on trucks.

Number two is I think this could lead to some very positive outcomes. It could convince more rural Americans that electric cars aren't some coastal elite conspiracy, but in fact a viable, fast, good experience. It could make electric cool to middle America. And that would be a great outcome.

Of course, the real issue here is that NHTSA barely does any pedestrian safety evaluation at all.

Tesla Cybertruck,"I've put avout 6,000 miles on mine. I genuinely love it but it's not perfect. I'll highly a few pros and cons.

PROS

1. The price - might seem odd but it's one of the cheapest options on the market is got my all wheel drive for 79k

2. It's just fun to drive, i had a model 3 and this thing can turn better with all wheel steering a and has the speed of a sports car. Just fun. 

3. The back seats fold up. I have dogs and they're getting up on age so having a flat stable surface is really nice. When the seats are up they have tons of room  back there for activities and theure low enough to not really be able to go crazy from seeing out the window. A weird but big pro. 

4. I've done ""truck"" stuff. From hauling dirt, rocks etc... I can't even tell it's loaded up. 

5. Lots of cargo room. I got this because I loved EVs and wanted something to go camping with and I've had a ton of fun.  It was hard choosing CT over rivian but the tesla charging network is second to none. And while other EVs can charge within tesla network it's super awkward to be taking up 2 spots because of how the ports are on other EVs and I hate the idea of being that guy when others are waiting. 



Some Cons...


1. Until recently it's been ""ew I don't like that design"" now it's some kind of political statement. I stay far out of politics but this truck has sucked me into them in a way I never expected. 

2. Stupid large ass windshield. It struggles to keep clean. I had bigger issues early on but after it broke in the whiper blade it's gotten better. 

3. Im a tall dude but I still can't reach Into the back of the cab... the angles make it impossible. Very annoying. 

4. The stainless steel is a mess to keep clean. I shut my door by touching the window. So expect to wrap it (3-7k $) extra

5. It's stupid long... barely fits in a normal garage. I somehow lucked out and it fits decently well in mine. 

6. It's the first of it's kind so getting spare tires and accessories are oddly hard. Not to mention if one blows out the towe truck driver i had no clue how to operate it. I literally had to drive it on the truck for him.

GMC Hummer EV,"Idk about you guys but I'm horrified of these new EV SUVs. The last thing we need is the average driver having access to a 10,000 lb, lifted monster accelerating 0-60 in 3 seconds. The amount of damage that momentum would do even at 35-40 miles per hour is horrifying.  Imagine that thing rear-ending an average compact sedan with nothing in the back to protect you...

I don't feel like responding to every comment individually so in short I will say this:

1. The destructive force of a skateboard designed EV hitting your car at speed X is not the same as that of an ICE car of the same weight, going at the same speed because the weight distribution is not the same.

2. Tesla sedans are not as concerning as a Hummer SUV that is heavier, does not handle as well, and rides higher up. Loss of control in an SUV is probably much easier than in a sedan.

3. Tesla's safety claims have long been scrutinized in the industry and by statisticians. There are even people that calculate fatality rates in Teslas are much higher than comparative ICE cars. I haven't looked into this, nor do I know the website/author, but judge for yourself: https://medium.com/@MidwesternHedgi/teslas-driver-fatality-rate-is-more-than-triple-that-of-luxury-cars-and-likely-even-higher-433670ddde17",2020-01-30,reddit

The Army would most likely be looking at options for a standard home station electric utility vehicle for on-base transport. Electric vehicles would actually be a great idea for military installations: decreases vehicle maintenance costs, range isn't a significant factor, electricity is cheaper than fuel (particularly when the average base transport vehicle is more of a miles/gallon situation), towing isn't a problem since range isn't a problem and electric motors are capable of impressive towing numbers, scalable/modular electric platforms can be applied towards a variety of vehicle types (people transport, machinery towing, aircraft towing, materials transport, security forces patrol vehicles).

There are *significant* technological advances that need to be made before EVs will ever have a significant presence even near a battlefield, but the military spends inordinate amounts of money maintaining and fueling gas vehicles that spend their whole lives on/around a single installation.

The looks are going to be a big factor.  The design of the CT is very polarizing.  Either you love it or you don't.  Big pickups, this is how they've looked for years, and truck people like that.  I know a ton of truck people.  Most of them follow the same pattern.  Buy the biggest, best, most equipped pickup they can afford, pay it off as fast as possible, mod the hell out of it, and drive it till it dies.  Rinse and repeat.

You want to get more EV's on the road, the Lightning will do that.

After about 15 minutes of him complaining about the complexity of diesel engines I asked him if he would ever consider an electric pickup truck. The tone of the conversation completely changed, and he asked me if I worked for Greenpeace. lol

He said he would never buy an electric truck because he needs the power of diesel to pull his boat. I explained to him that modern diesel trains actually use electric motors to do the pulling, the diesel engines are just generators, so electric motors are fully capable of pulling his boat.

There are potential range and other issues of course, but that aside, he still thought electric trucks were the dumbest idea he had ever heard and he basically ignored me the rest of the flight, even when I offered to tell him how to resolve the problem he was having with his diesel truck.

Now, the reason I asked him about an electric pickup was because I had just been in Detroit, consulting with one of the automakers about building an electric pickup truck.

But US auto makers seem dead set against selling affordable smaller cars. They want to sell giant overpriced chonkers. I bet the margin is higher.

I think what they really fear with smaller cheaper EVs is cars that require virtually no maintenance, last forever, are cheap to operate, and are low margin. That's what customers want but it's deadly to their profits.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"It really just comes down to pricing. We are in the market for a new car, and we looked at the Lightning. Went back and forth with the dealership a few times but the out of door pricing was so crazy. We loved the utility aspect of the truck, and we would use it for that. And loved the idea of it being electric so for the short daily commutes it wouldn't feel terrible vs gas. 

But out of door pricing it was closer to the same cost as most luxury SUV's we were considering with it being more expensive than some of the luxury SUV's we looked at. We liked it, but not for 80k. If it was more closely priced to something like a Volvo XC90 at 60k, it'd be a no brainer for us. 

My guess is that the Cybertruck just has more fan boys who are willing to pay the extra to have it, vs a F150 is more about price and use. And if the price is too high it won't sell.",2025-02-05,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"It tows a lot smoother than a F350 (considering the springs are lighter), but doesn't have quite the weight to stay as stable on heavier loads. I have to squeeze the trailer brake every little bit when hauling cattle, when they shift around it is enough to start a little fish tail, but I also don't use a weight distribution hitch, just a 2 3/8 ball or whatever size it is. Works great, but only get around 1 mile/kWh so around 120-130 miles round trip. 

As a grocery getter, it does a lot better. I get around 3 miles/kWh in town, including a 1 mile drive on highway to my house. Costs me $2.23 to go 100 miles just getting groceries and $6.69 to tow 100 miles when charging at home.

With the FCSP, I can top up from 45% to 85% in around 2-3 hours. 15%-85% in 5-6 hours. The range is only a factor on long trips otherwise normally the most I drive in a day is around 100 miles. More often 50 or less. Just top up once a week or every day or two when driving a bunch. 

Road trips aren't bad, just take longer to get there. Added around 9 hours when I went the the eclipse in April 650 miles away, and 4 hours of them were waiting for an EA stall with only 2 chargers operating and 4 cars that were completely dead in front of me. But otherwise, most stops were a half hour at most and half of it was getting food in the gas station or wandering a mall. Then I'd just catch up on my phone the rest of the time, snaps, Reddit, etc. Around $30-40 a stop. 

My main complaints are fighting the computer to use the screen and features I need, and the truck really struggles running inductive loads in the bed with the 30 amp cap for starting current on motors. Motor might only pull 4 amps when running, but pull 40 to start. So it trips, or has a large voltage drop (I've seen it down to 90 volts on 120v outlets before when starting a motor). Blue Cruise/lane centering hate glasses and will brake check you even when you're watching the road, to make you watch the road ...

Overall, it's fantastic. There's a few things that are annoying about it, but nothing that makes me regret buying it. I love it, and as long as use case doesn't require it (gooseneck, grain hauling with semis, tractors, etc.) I'll probably never buy ICE again.",2024-09-18,reddit

Funny how Jim Farley said that Ford wasn't going to compete with Tesla on price.  CT hasn't even started shipping yet and Ford is cutting prices.   I thought that Jim said Ford was going to offer superior value to customers such that they wouldn't have to compete on price ?

Also funny that the biggest cut ($ amount, percentage) is on the base model and not the premium models.  Just goes to show how much Ford is gouging on their high end offerings. 

Also funny is how Ford criticized Tesla when they cut prices, like prices of vehicles are never supposed to go down.   And now Ford is cutting prices, again.  We are living in a new world.",2023-07-17,reddit

The interior is bland and the design language is weak.

It is trying to do too much and the result is a confused and unfocused design that doesn't perform well as a luxury car or as a tough truck. It's not good at anything. For the price you can get much more luxury or much more ruggedness in other brands.

GMC Hummer EV,"I‚Äôm honestly confused about why these cars (along with the Raptor, TREX, etc) exists other than to attract attention. 

- They fail at the basic purpose of full size trucks, which is to tow over any appreciable distance (most in the double digit range, about a third of a comparably sized conventional truck)

- They‚Äôre fast in a straight line, but handle far worse than even the most basic sporty sedans and even a lot of SUVs

- They‚Äôre also 6 figures in cost.

So what we have are several trucks that can‚Äôt tow, handle worse than a sports sedan/wagon/SUV, and cost over double the average vehicle cost. Who are these for?

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I‚Äôm hopeful they take this pause to fix their model year situation. They have been way off on the F series platforms since the chip shortage. I took delivery of my 2022 F350 in February of 2023. I then bought a 2023 Lightning in August of 2023 and six months later they were still building 2023‚Äôs. 

The 2024‚Äôs have only been out for a few months as most automakers are already producing 2025‚Äôs. Your new car lot looks weird when it seems like you‚Äôre always selling last years model. 

And as for sales‚Ä¶ The Silverado and Cybertruck are now readily available and in the case of the Silverado‚Ä¶ possibly a better product. Ford needs to do a 9-10% price cut and make the sticker more aligned with what folks are actually paying. 

For example most on the Lightning subreddit are paying mid 60‚Äôs for a Lariat ER, the sticker is $80-82K and scares people off. An equivalent ICE lariat is $75K before rebates so the Lightning is very competitive in house and in general pickups have gotten very expensive.

GMC Hummer EV,"I‚Äôm really interested to see how the Ultium platform works out. 

It seems to me that one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest advantages as a startup was that they don‚Äôt have any car platform, and hadn‚Äôt built up a business and corporate structure around the kind of compartmentalized optimization that makes sense when building a highly complex and mature piece of technology like a car. 

As a result, they didn‚Äôt have the mentality of digging through the parts bin to save costs, as there was no parts bin. And that sounds disparaging of parts bins - in fact, companies like VW and Toyota are able to make incredibly good engines and transmissions, as well as switchgear and shock absorbers and all the rest, because they‚Äôve got so much volume to spread the costs out between, and can have small, highly effective teams working on each part. And with a mature technology, you already know about what the optimal solution looks like; engineering between parts and teams is far less critical than it is with a truly new product, in which you don‚Äôt know what optimal is. 

Anyway, the point is not to talk about Tesla, but to say that as EVs mature, the commoditized approach of highly developed platforms, where it‚Äôs easy to add new vehicles in new segments, and core things like batteries and motors get used over and over again - that‚Äôs where things will probably go. 

Ultium and MEB are the two platforms we‚Äôve seen the most technical detail about, at least that I‚Äôve seen the most detail about. They both seem super flexible and well thought out, so it should be interesting to see how quickly GM can turn the platform into a whole array of different vehicles, as VW is starting to do.",2021-12-18,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"I‚Äôve got a Lightning and it‚Äôs a great all around truck, but it also doesn‚Äôt excel in any one area. 

It‚Äôs not as fast as a Rivian or Tesla, it doesn‚Äôt offer an adjustable air suspension, software is probably a generation behind, it doesn‚Äôt have as much range as a Rivian or GM‚Äôs offerings, efficiency isn‚Äôt great, etc, etc.

What it is good at is being basically a converted F150, which is what I was looking for.

However I think most buyers are on opposite ends of a pricing spectrum here. You either have the buyer willing to spend big money ($80k+ msrp), but they want to be on the cutting edge of technology and/or show off.

Or, you have the customer who isn‚Äôt sure about EVs but is willing to try it if they think it‚Äôs reliable, simple, and will save them money. For these customers the price has to be right. They‚Äôre probably looking in the 50k msrp range. 

The Lightning is trying to find its place in the middle. 

Sales are decent and I think it should continue to be offered as an F150 trim for fleets and other buyers that want that converted F150 EV (and lower the price about $6,000.)

However, if Ford (and the legacy automakers) are really serious about this EV thing they need to take what they‚Äôve learned and bring out a next gen EV trucks that actually smash the high end of the market and the budget end of the market.",2025-02-05,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"Just because everyone is moving from being epidemiologists, to legal scholars, historians, and now crash test experts; remember that vehicle safety testing is a self-certification process in which vehicles are safety tested by their manufacturers.

NHTSA does not approve vehicles for sale in the United States; manufacturers approve their own vehicles when they feel the vehicle meets standards laid out by NHTSA.  

Later, NHTSA may do some testing on a sample of the product from ‚Äúthe fleet‚Äù (meaning they go buy one), and check if that sample meets standards; but that would be after thousands or tens of thousands are sold.

> The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Vehicle Safety Act), NHTSA‚Äôs organic
statute, creates a **self-certification system of compliance, in which vehicle and equipment
manufacturers certify that their products meet applicable standards.** NHTSA chooses vehicles
and equipment **from the fleet** to test for compliance, and pursues enforcement actions when the
Agency finds either a non-compliance or a defect posing an unreasonable risk to safety.

> **NHTSA does not pre-approve new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle technologies.** NHTSA
will continue to exercise its available regulatory authority over Automated Driving Systems (or
ADS) using its existing regulatory tools: interpretations, exemptions, notice-and-comment
rulemaking, and defects and enforcement authority. NHTSA has the authority to identify safety
defects, **allowing the Agency to recall vehicles** or equipment that pose an unreasonable risk to
safety even when there is no applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).

> **It is important to note that NHTSA does not prohibit the introduction of new motor vehicles or
motor vehicle technologies into the vehicle fleet,** provided those vehicles and technologies meet
existing FMVSS.1 A vehicle or equipment manufacturer need ask NHTSA about a new
technology or vehicle design **only when** it will not comply with applicable standards, or when
there might be a question as to compliance. If a manufacturer anticipates having such a question,
then requests for interpretations, exemptions, and rulemakings are the methods that a
manufacturer can use to pursue answers from the Agency. Occasionally, some of these
regulatory tools have taken several months to several years for NHTSA to issue, but the Agency
has committed to expediting its actions regarding automation.

> To aid regulated entities and the public in understanding the use of the Agency‚Äôs regulatory tools
(including the introduction of new ADS), NHTSA has prepared an information and guidance
document. This document, which has wider application beyond automation, provides
instructions, practical guidance, and assistance to entities seeking to employ those tools.

Tesla Cybertruck,"Just going to drop this same line every time I see one of these Tesla recall posts:



Every vehicle manufacture has multiple recalls on each build... new and older. Like a combined millions of vehciles ever year across different brands. This is nothing new or substantial. It's just getting blown up by main stream media oulets.. The ones that are consistently getting called out for lying to us all the time.

¬†It's a recall not a factory buy back like the headlines portray by saying ""recalled thousands of Teslas"". Recalls mean you go to the dealer and they fix it for free under warranty and then you drive it back home. I'm sure any of you that have owed/own a new GM, Chrysler, Ford, Subaru,..¬† the list goes on but if you own a new vehicle you'll get recalls. If you own an older model year, you'll get less recalls.

When you buy a new vehicle nearly half of the price tag is to cover the new car warranty so the factory can keep up with reimbursing dealers for warranty repairs on vehicles sold as well as the anticipation of the various forms of recalls/campaigns prompted by dealer feedback, customer feedback, and NHSTA investigations.

GM had a recall for literally putting EMPTY heated seat modules in their new trucks.. like a plastic shells instead of a computer module.¬† They all do dumb shit all the time.¬†

Quality has fallen to the way side in today's automotive industry especially in domestic brands. Factorys want retuning customers not reliable builds, thats why they promote ""brand loyalty"" purchase incentives. Is what it is. This is a result of us buyers always wanting something newer and better.¬†

I know this for a fact because I manage a warranty claims department for the largest dealership conglomerate in my state who sells and services multiple brands.¬†

The resolve? Buy something built before 2010 and keep it running or buy new and trade in every 3 years or 36k miles or lease... unless your upside down on your loan for driving the piss out of it.

Ps. Most everything built after 2019 seems to be junk unless it's top tier brands.. at best.

A vehicle is the worst return investment you can make. Just try and do it smart to loose the least amount while getting what you feel is most valued to your wants, needs, and financial situation. All brands have pros and cons and no one vehicle or ""deal"" is best for everyone¬†

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Koons has a pretty crappy reputation.  My own personal experience involved the purchase of a used Mazda CX-5 that they advertised as having the full tech package.  So I priced it out based on that and decided ‚Äúyup that‚Äôs a good deal.‚Äù  Bought the car, and on the drive home realized when it got dark that it didn‚Äôt have the upgraded headlamps, that the cruise control did not have the radar distance function, noticed that the mirrors were not auto-dimming, etc.

Got home and called them and said ‚Äúhey, you sold me a different car than advertised.  I‚Äôll return the car or we can renegotiate the price.‚Äù  They refused to renegotiate and at first they stood their ground on all sales being final.

Fortunately, I‚Äôm an attorney. And I‚Äôm very familiar with deceptive trade practice laws in most states.  Not only would they have had to take the car back, but they would have owed me additional compensation, attorneys fees, civil penalties, plus any fines that the VA gov agency would have wanted to tack on.

I got escalated up to the GM and he finally caved.  Took car back for full refund (as if it never happened).

Tesla Cybertruck,"LoL

""Having said that, something interesting here is that in Q4 2024, Tesla only sold 23,640 ‚Äúother model‚Äù vehicles. These include the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck.

Tesla says the Model S and Model X lines at the Fremont, California plant can produce 100,000 vehicles, and the Cybertruck line at Giga Texas has an installed capacity for 125,000 trucks per year.

These three vehicles together should sell 225,000 units per year; however, the Q4 23,640 delivery means less than 100,000 units of Tesla Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck deliveries annually.

Even more concerning, the ‚Äúother model‚Äù category generated almost the same 23,000 sales in Q4 2023. This was before Tesla barely started delivering Cybertrucks. Fast-forward a year, and Tesla is selling the same number of ‚Äúother model‚Äù vehicles despite ramping up Cybertruck production.

Based on this data, the Cybertruck does not appear to be creating a new market for Tesla; instead, it seems to be cannibalizing Model S and Model X sales.""",2025-01-30,reddit

This vehicle will rock. Massive range, great speed, and the ability to tow pretty much anything you would consider attaching to a pickup truck.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Love my '23 XLT SR.    I have had no trouble in the nearly 7000 miles driven since June, and it's one of the best trucks I've ever owned.

That list of *past trucks* includes a 2015 F-350 King Range 7.3, a 2012 F-250 diesel 7.3, 2006 F-350 dually 6.4L diesel, 2000 Dodge 2500 5.9L diesel, and somewhere in that mix was a 2018 Chevy Silverado, a 2020 Yukon Denali, and a mid 2000's RAM 1500 with the crappy non-Hemi V8 (what a mistake) that I try to forget.

Why is the Lightning my favorite?

First of all, I no longer tow heavy -- I had the diesels to tow a relatively law RV travel trailer, and since moving out to 30 acres of woods in the country, I no longer have the desire to camp ""elsewhere"" -- so the big trucks were no longer necessary.   I sold the last diesel in the era when diesel fuel was nearly $4.30 a gallon, and while diesel gets great fuel economy for what it is -- it still cost me $100 to fill up every week just to drive my empty truck around.    In terms of fuel savings, the Lightning costs me $13 to ""fill-er up"" at home on a 48A/240V charger mounted on my pole barn, vs. $60+ to put the equivalent amount of gas into a comparably equipped gas F-150.

Second, I love the extreme power of the Lightning.   Until you drive one, *you have no idea what you're in for.*  The truck is just a hair slower than the 460 HP Mustang GT it replaced.  Sure, it won't go *as fast* due to the speed limiter, but it will the 1/4 mile done in the mid-12s and 0-60 in 4 seconds.

Third, it's quiet, refined, and useful.   Think of it as a 7500 pound 4WD Hearse.   This thing is smooth, silent, and comfortable.    Even in XLT trim with cloth seats and plastic everywhere, the build quality is second to none.    My Yukon Denali and King Ranches were nice, but they were nearly double the price.

The truck has plenty of range for my day to day needs, I charge to 90% and I get 215-220 miles with that level of charge.

Cybertruck?   I couldn't deal with the rubber-necking you'd get in one.   They're pretty cool, futuristic, capable, and fairly reliable.   They're also $40K+ more money, have a long waiting list, and look like something out Buck Rogers.

If there was anything out there I'd consider, it would be Silverado EV for the massive 200+ kWH battery and range, but then again they're $40K+ more money.  LOL.  See the theme here?

Coming from an F350, you need to ask yourself about payload an towing capacity, if you're using your truck for heavy-duty tasks.   My XLR SR has a spec'd towing rating of 5000 pounds.  The springs, hitch, and hardware itself will tow 7200 pounds, but without a brake controller and the additional cooling - I'd keep it on flat level ground and keep speeds 55 MPH or less.    My diesels would tow between 12-14K.   That's a big difference and might rule out a Lightning if you need it.",2024-09-18,reddit

The clip, which used much of the same imagery from her first presidential campaign ad, featured a new voice-over that appeared to be digitally altered to sound like Harris.

Chevy Silverado EV,"My frequent destination airport Budget Rental lot (Denver) has a ton of Silverado EVs. As a potential buyer of an RST, I was eager to rent one and see if I liked it. 

First off, it was near impossible to get one despite there being 15+ on the pick-up (vs drop-off) side of the lot!  I asked for one and the space they assigned me was a Ford Lightning.  I went back in with the location of several Silverado EVs. NONE were fully charged and they ended up sending me out on one with 30% charge.

These rental companies all over bought and don‚Äôt have the charging infrastructure to get them ready.  It‚Äôs rather ridiculous.

As many of you know, renting an EV sucks anyway - unless your hotel has chargers, your office has chargers (if traveling for work), or if you know you can find an ultra fast charger near a mall / restaurant that you can hang out at on the night before you return.

Back to the Silverado EV‚Ä¶. 

I gotta say, the Silverado WT just isn‚Äôt impressive to me compared to other EVs - aside from range.  The acceleration is meh, the cabin is utilitarian.  Your coffee or water bottle will slide around and even tip over because the cup holders are just huge round circles.  There is a vertical slot for your cellphone, but there isn‚Äôt room for anything else unless you toss it into the ridiculously huge and perhaps bottomless pit between the dash and cup holders.  

The dash has many different cut-outs and textures that serve to only annoyingly reflect against the windshield. 

The ui is not intuitive - my happiest moment was figuring out how to simply turn off the headlights.  

And the cabin rattles.  This thing rattled more than my 20+ year old Avalanche!

Hey, at least it had Apple CarPlay.

The RST needs to be a huge cabin and acceleration upgrade for me to consider it.  The WT is not a great demo for such a pricey platform.",2025-03-04,reddit

GMC Hummer EV,"Nice work by GM, they have impressive EV tech. No doubt they will have strong EV offerings to come. I grew up in a GM family and root for them. 

Now, I am curious about EV impact on cars in general though. What happens to cars like Civic SI, Elantra N line, Golf GTI, Veloster/Elantra N, Corolla, Camaro, Mustang, Challenger, Charger, BRZ/86, Golf R, and the rest of that segment in the 20-50K range that offer manual transmissions, good overall range, and lightweight sporty/sports cars(with some exceptions)? Do automakers want to kill these cars soon or will they fight for them to remain ICE? 

If these cars go EV, how heavy will they be and get they offer similar value or will they get much more costly? Like if Honda Civic SI went EV, I don't see it how they can make it fun with pure EV powertrain, cost 26K, have solid range, and be lightweight. 

So far, we have seen Camaro might be killed off, rumors of Camaro-like EV, Mustang due to go full EV but with suv offering and now supposed sedan offerring on the way. Mustang coupe may die off? Challenger/Charger living on until 2024 with ICE. No news on what comes after that. Automakers are not addressing this besides Porsche which is conflicted on Cayman/Boxster future and wants 911 to remain ICE/Hybrid for a long time.",2021-04-06,reddit

I believe a huge percentage of the reservation holders wouldn‚Äôt have bought it even at that price. Availability has gone up and prices are way down and yet there is no spike in sales. I don‚Äôt like the truck so I‚Äôm surprised they sold as many as they did. I think the more interesting question is whether or not there is a price that the truck will sell, where Tesla can make a profit. Even at a much lower price where more will see it as a good value it will still be expensive. How many people really will feel like they need the truck and don‚Äôt mind the stigma?

Tesla Cybertruck,"Nobody wants this compromise of a truck. And I don't even necessarily dislike the design.

The design was supposed to represent function over form, in that it was supposed to lend itself to cheap and simple manufacturing via metal origami. That was supposed to translate to a much cheaper price.

I would have been fine driving a truck that looks like this because it would have been cheaper, and I wouldn't have minded dinging up a stainless steel truck while doing ACTUAL work, that was worth like 30k.

I'm not about to let a single scratch appear on my $100k truck. It's completely impractical.

It's like they realized the whole origami folding process wasn't gonna work, this negating all the manufacturing cost saving, but they still had to make it look the way they planned because ""it looks kewl.""

By contrast, the Ford F-150 Lighting Pro is only available with the 230-mile standard battery (EDIT: at least to consumers, Fleets can get the ER).

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Obviously, it‚Äôs going to have slower charging times and lack some features, but the fact that they‚Äôre offering any EV at a price that low is damn impressive considering the Hummer is over twice as much and the Rivian truck is $30K more just starting out. You‚Äôre still going to get a very usable truck for $40K though. That‚Äôs cheaper than or comparable to most other full size trucks with 4WD let alone some midsize trucks out there. It‚Äôs a good step forward to get people into that market. Still, I‚Äôm not jumping into that market just yet unless I‚Äôm forced to. I have nothing against EVs because I actually built one in college, but I like hearing noise when I step on the gas pedal too much, and I live in a rural area with one charging station.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Oh, another list.  Here goes:

Pros:

* the acceleration is actually too much power in my mind
* quiet & really nice drive
* plenty of room
* blue cruise is so nice if you drive limited access highways regularly
* I wanted heated seats but I like the ventilated seats every bit as much
* LR battery tipped the scales to a huge plus since the 240mile previous limit; only publicly charge now on trips
* F150 based so many accessories are interchangeable; do not get F150 floor fitted mats though
* Unlike most other EVs, this one is stealthy; doesn't scream EV; people only know it's an EV if they know it
* frunk size is absolutely huge
* 30A 220 outlet in bed (there's also a bunch of 110 outlets in the frunk and bed); 110 outlet in the front seat for a workspace
* cost of ownership; many describe an EV as tires, wipers and windshield washer fluid

Cons:

* charging speed is limited to 170kW; although it does charge from 20% to 80% in well less than 30 minutes
* cost; Ford is pushing the top of the tax rebate limit so many trucks are right at the $80k limit
* I wish the front and rear LED bars were more traditional (the one exception to the EV stealth pro above)
* I think everyone has issues with the auto closing frunk and/or liftgate
* dealers support; dealers make more money from selling the ICE/hybrid brothers to this truck so they don't sell them properly; dealers also don't service as many of these as the ICE/hybrid brothers so service isn't as comprehensive (I had a dealer call me when they couldn't find my truck almost a week after the first of two recalls were completed because the parts for the second recall came in; they wouldn't say they lost it but they didn't know I had picked it up; mind you, I wasn't going to take it in until all the parts were in and they blew that off)
* I don't tow but I'd be remiss to not mention the poor mileage when towing a non-aerodynamic trailer (I did pull a small utility trailer and saw no differences but it was below the tailgate)",2024-09-18,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Okay -- basically the Lightning is an F-150 with an all-electric drive train.  It drives and handles great for a pickup truck (honestly, the best pickup I've ever driven) but in the end it is a full-size pickup truck.  On the pro side, it is good for hauling stuff -- you have a 5'6"" bed plus a grocery-cart-sized frunk and room for 5 adults.  On the con side, it is a full-size pickup truck and doesn't fit easily in urban parking garages or narrow alleys.

As a BEV, you *absolutely* have to have way to charge regularly while you're doing something else.    For most folks, that means charging at home while you sleep.  This is the biggest advantage of an EV: you come home, plug in, and go about your evening.  Tomorrow morning you're charged back up without you having to do or think about anything.  *You never realized how annoying it is to run to the gas station until you never have to do it again.*

There are a few markets in the US where electricity is more expensive than gas.  In general, if 10 kWh of electricity costs *less* than 1 gallon of gas, then you'll save money driving on electrons.  For example, where I live electricity is $0.14 per kWh, so 10 kWh costs $1.40.  This is less than gas (at $3.30), so I save driving on electricity.  I save even more because my electric company has a deal for $0.08 per kWh if I charge late at night.

So, if you own your home and park in a garage, carport, or private driveway then you're probably good (you may have to get an electrician to install a circuit for you).  If you're in a condo or rental situation, check with your landlord or owners' association before you proceed.  A *few* lucky people have reliable free- or low-cost charging at work, and that is a solution too.

Aside from the charging situation, there are a few use cases that the Lightning doesn't really support.  If you regularly (once a week or more) drive more than about 250 miles a day, you may find even the ER truck has a frustratingly short range.  The same is true if you often (once a month or more) tow more than 150 miles a day.  Finally, if you road trip, be aware that you'll get about an 80:20 split between drive time and charging time -- you can expect trips to take about 25% longer than in a gas vehicle, and you should expect to pre-plan road trips like a pilot pre-plans a multi-hop flight.",2024-09-18,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"On the upside, it's extremely cheap to drive for its size if you can charge at home. My power is 11 cents per kwh and it comes out to about $0.05 per mile. I'm projecting mine to break even versus the cheapest 4wd crew-cab F-150 you can build around the 100k mile mark, which is coincidentally the end of its warranty, and perhaps save me $25k by the end of its life cycle if it lasts like Ford claims it should. And no stopping for gas. I've had mine since July and I'm probably going to make my first fast-charging stop during a trip in October. The 300 mile battery on the long-range versions is a lot when it's always topped off in the morning.

It's very smooth and quiet to drive. This is really growing on me. Very nice to be in, significantly imprpves the experience of listening to music while droving. It accelerates like a sports car too, which I don't care about, but the fact that it corners surprisingly well for its size is a minor comfort perk.

The onboard power has fairly niche use-cases, but if you're in one of those niches it can be a big deal.

The frunk is a significant storage place. Not quite big enough for my table saw or miter saw, but it'll hold a toolbelt and several tool boxes, or a pretty big suitcase. It's a great place for things that are a little dirty for the cab but still need to stay out of the rain.


As for downsides, it doesn't DC fast-charge very fast even for a typical modern electric car. It'll suck a little to road-trip with (good thing it's a comfy vehicle to be in, at least), and suck a lot to haul bulky trailers with due to aerodynamic drag at highway speeds. It is also important to note that it doesn't normally get the advertised 320 mile range on the highway. It'll get more than that just trundling around town, like maybe as much as 375, but more like 280 on the highway or less if you're speeding or climbing a lot of hills.

Mine works for me. No regrets other than which charger I bought for my house. But there are use-cases for which it is prohibitively bad. Think about the tasks you do with trucks regularly and see if you'll need to fast-charge regularly. If so, maybe you don't want one, but if not, it ends up being a very capable vehicle with clear advantages over its ICE competitors IMO.",2024-09-18,reddit
Chevy Silverado EV,"Once EVs start to become cheaper (like these), I think one of the big bright spots of EVs is the hope that they might significantly raise the floor for cars.

Had they prepared with a 25k model for this or next year it would maybe make a splash in other developing countries, as is with the push for autonomous cars, it's heading towards bankruptcy. To be clear I have no doubt they can make ever improving level 3 systems, but at level 4 and 5 they need to be held accountable for any crash or incident, with the tech being so unreliable and unproven, the outcome can be no other.

The expectations for the next few years will be more range due to improved efficiency, shorter charging time of 10 minutes with 5C or better batteries and cheaper and better cars at the entry level, not i3 level ones but more like Bolt and Kona at around 20k or under.

Tesla Cybertruck,"One of the more challenging consequences of Mr Musk's personality type is he cannot share the spotlight. BYD started out making Nokia phone batteries and graduated to making iPads. They were making less than 500K NEVs per year in 2020 when the tidal wave of their growth emerged. They have since overwhelmed everyone in China including Tesla. They will certainly make 5.5M vehicles this year and perhaps more. That will be about 3X of Tesla production. They introduced a cool car this year called the YangWang U8 which can navigate through water. Shortly thereafter Musk started with the late night fantasy talk of CyberTruck as a boat. He cannot resist. Here's a link of the amazing vehicle in question. Not sure it looks cooler than a CyberTruck though :) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoW1pNHEhLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoW1pNHEhLo)

It‚Äôll be interesting to see how this affects things in off-road performance tests once people get their hands on them. 

Being closer to a full size truck will still make it unwieldy in some scenarios, but competition is good and maybe the Cybertruck will push Rivian to implement similar features (locking diffs, faster charging, more outlets, bidirectional charging).

Horrible consumer experience for all the folks who have preordered and waited. IMO wouldn't be surprised if there is another price increase before deliveries happen.  I suspect they think people thought more of their vehicle than they think of it.  They will have a lot more competition in the next year or two as more BEV's are released.

Tesla Cybertruck,"Problem with Lightning is Ford can't seem to make a profit on it which puts it at risk of getting cut completely. It may be under priced for Ford. 
I think all EV trucks are at risk of going extinct. They can't compete with ICE's for towing range, and take too long to charge and cost a lot and aren't really that efficient. Most people can't tell if you paid the EV premium or not as they usually look like any other truck. Pull through chargers are rare so unhitching a trailer to charger every 90 miles is a PITA.
From a design standpoint the only way to fix range is to throw more battery at it which takes even longer to charge, jacks the price up substantially; and reduces its efficiency as it now has to lug its own bloated weight around all day just for the occasional tow. More battery means more structural weight to hold the weight of the battery in place. 

So while a Hummer EV has a 3k lb battery pack that only takes you 300 miles, a gas F-150 can take you over 500 miles on 130 lbs of gas. It's just so hard to beat the energy density of gas.",2024-10-14,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pros : Both men and women will approach you.

Pros: Literally powered by Zeus.

Cons: You start ignoring the existance of gas stations , like 90s era malls and rollerskating rinks.",2024-09-18,reddit
Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pros:

* It's the smoothest vehicle I've ever been in‚Äîtruck or otherwise.
* Being an F-150, all the mods and accessories already work seamlessly.
* Extremely low cost of ownership (gas and maintenance).

Cons:

* Expensive upfront cost.
* Public charging can be inconvenient if you can't charge at home.
* Ford isn't a software company. While I don‚Äôt mind the current software, earlier versions have had legitimate issues, according to what others have said.

Overall:

I can‚Äôt see myself getting a different truck‚ÄîI've been spoiled by this one. That being said, I could see myself opting for a smaller EV in the future if I needed to downsize, as this truck is pretty large.",2024-09-18,reddit
Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pros:

* More than a pickup truck. Good family car, particularly with the addition of the large frunk compared to ICE
* Roomy. 3 seats in back with room left for a dog. Big back seat. 
* Back seats fold up and the back is a HUGE cargo area. Makes up for smaller bed.
* Cheaper to operate (assuming charge at home) compared to ICE F-150, making it an option as a daily driver
* Affordable, compares in price to many larger EVs out there and lowest price electric pickup. Best value for the utility, IMO
* Access to Tesla supercharger network (but strongly prefer charging at home)
* Smooth, quiet ride. It's a dream to drive, especially with Adaptive Cruise Control on in traffic. 
* The torque!

Cons:

* Towing range sucks. Probably not what you want if you tow regularly at any distance over 50 miles or so. 
* Small bed (5.5ft). But frunk and back seat area make up for it IMO
* Poor aero mean poor efficiency even when not towing compare to other EVs. 
* If you can't charge at home regularly, I would not recommend EV at all. Public charging is a convenience, not something you want to depend on. 

The cons don't apply to me personally. I love just about everything about the Lightning. Only thing I'm changing is the shifter. I hate the bulky shifter and am planning to put in a dial shifter from another Ford. But some people like the traditional shifter.",2024-09-18,reddit

The ability to turn on the AC while at the check out counter is great. 
I love the frunk, perfect height for groceries.
Pro power is awesome, can run tools and pumps and such at the far end of my farm, and can power the house if the power goes out.
Cons: 
It is a bit slower getting to your destination on long trips (but a lot more fun)

Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pros: tons of things you can upgrade on the truck if you're moderately handy (I added adaptive cruise control, heated steering wheel, passive entry, securicode keypad, rain sensing wipers, and running boards to mine)
Quiet
Super quick
Nice ride
Tons of room for storage
Lots of ways to power your stuff (I power my travel trailer from my truck)
Never have to be worried about fueling up before I go to work as the battery is always topped off in the morning

Cons: towing range isn't great but it's fine for the towing I do with my boat and trailer

The interior materials are low end. They just are. Similar to a work truck. On top of that, they are assembled with the typical complete lack of fit and finish, and no QC department. 

The exterior is the same story. They are not true stainless steel. It‚Äôs a low quality steel. Many of the panels are attached to the underbody with glue. GLUE. Which naturally causes them to fall apart. Throwing metal panels into traffic.

Tesla Cybertruck,"Recently got to test drive one.

From the jump, I thought that the vehicle looked comical, not serious, a joke, a one off just because they can. Then they actually produced it, and it literally broke my mind as an engineer and car enthusiast. Why go through all of this to prove a point? 

And I think that's the appeal, it exists, when critical thinking says it shouldn't. It's like a big F you to standards, and ""sticking it to the man"" in a way.

These were my take aways:

- The steer by wire combined with the rear wheel steering indeed helped maneuver the long wheel base of the truck. 
- Why does it even have a rearview mirror? 
- The blindspots are ridiculous. 
- I was being constantly blinded by the sun reflecting on the steel while waiting on line. 
- I forgot that big ass wiper even existed. 
- The front of the car felt like it was 20ft away from the driver's seat.
- It was quiet for a pick up with large tires
- it has a good power train
- the squircle steering hole was a little weird to use, felt like I was in an arcade driving simulator.

Overall thought: the sum of it's parts are less than the parts themselves. Meaning, it's great that there's all this new and adopted tech, but it just doesn't blow my mind from a package standpoint.

I came to the understanding that you REALLY need to like the 'design over function' character of the truck, or really fall into the hype to love it.

I drove a Gen2 Rivian R1S shortly after and as an overall package I preferred it over the Cybertruck. It just felt more purposeful and thoughtful.",2024-10-14,reddit
Ford F-150 Lightning,"Recently test drove a Platinum and despite the hate here it is objectively a nice truck. It doesn‚Äôt look like some Cyberpunk 2077 off-shoot with warped body lines, it has a good amount of technology but not a tiresome amount, it‚Äôs insanely quiet in the cab, very comfortable, and it has an insane amount of get-up. 

Biggest problem with these is the dealers don‚Äôt want to sell them and they are overpriced as a result too. We‚Äôre 2 months away from 2025 and I recently saw a lightly used 2023 Lightning Platinum still selling for 67K that was used as the managers truck. 

Ford dealers hate this thing because there is zero money to be made from service. By most accounts the issues with them are primarily software-based and thus they can‚Äôt milk the consumer further as useless middle-men. 

The Lariat trims have absurd pricing(65-80K) and many cabin features + options are locked away to the Platinum trim. For example, the leather seats in the Lariat are straight up taken from taxi cabs in the 2000s with their black and gray color scheme. You pay nearly 70K for this thing and it looks like it has school bus seats. 

The Platinum new is between $80K-$90K, there are poor if any lease incentives and it is not eligible for the $7500 credit as well. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense, for $80-$90K you could get a Raptor, TRX, RHO or a fully loaded(Platinum, KR, Limited, Tungsten, Denali Ultimate/High Country) HD diesel. Not to mention the Silverado/RAM REV/Sierra EV which all have much better numbers and are stand-alone platforms that are purpose-built for this. 

I think these are going to be an even bigger flop moving forward without major improvements and Ford strong-arming dealers to sell them. It was a good move at the beginning but Ford dropped the ball and now competition has caught up.

The RAMCharger in particular looks like it‚Äôs posed to take the lead in ICE-alternative trucks in my opinion.",2024-10-31,reddit

Rivian R1T,"Rivian definitely need to fix the charging issue. My breaker had never tripped while charging for over the pass five plus year with a different electric car but had done so 4-5 times with the r1s. My max rating for the mobile charger is 16amp, but I had to dial it down to 10amp for it to avoid tripping. Now then I use the faster charger we just install, same thing, 48amp is max but I have to use 40. The Rivian app doesn‚Äôt warn you about the vehicle stopped charging, which is a disappointment. When I moved from the faster charger to the slower one, the vehicle doesn‚Äôt adjust and of course trip the breaker again.

For the clicking noise at slow speed, it is suppose to be normal because that‚Äôs the air suspension adjusting.

Best of luck getting your issues resolved and it‚Äôs sad you have to go through them. I have an hood alignment issue due to get service on December 8th. It‚Äôs at a very just service center so I don‚Äôt know if I should even bring it in or just ride it out until more centers are open.

Chevy Silverado EV,"Same deal as fast food restaurants offering healthy options on their menu's. While relatively few people order them. (realistically few people looking for a healthy meal will chose the golden arches...)

They act somewhat as a halo produced, and they make people better about their meal choice even if they don't opt for the healthy option.

And of course it makes the fast food brand seem health conscious (even if 99% of their sales are not those items)

&#x200B;

So for an automaker, the mere existence of an EV in the lineup means they can win the brand green cred, and the brand seem more environmentally conscious (even if they sell zero or a low number)

&#x200B;

There are also a couple more factors at play.

* Sends the message to both consumers and regulators that the brand is working on EV's. So there isn't a need for consumers to leave the brand for a brand with better environmental credentials, and there isn't a need for regulators to take harsh action on vehicle emissions.
* An attempt to retain their loyal customers, who might stay with the brand  if they know there is an EV in the pipeline (perhaps even buying another non-plug-in car in the meantime), rather than deciding they need to leave their favorite brand to get an EV, and they might as well do it now.",2022-10-31,reddit

Now that our Bolt battery replacement appears to be imminent, we called to cancel the pre-order, and they're giving us our $500 back later this week. They never tried to jack up the price on us while we had the order in place.

What would help US mfgs who have invested in the future is increased EV credit for buyers.  Even credits to mfgs for production of EV's.

To the F150 specifically, average F150 is $60k so it is an expensive vehicle to start with but the market is mostly anti-EV white males (86%) so F150 EV's are selling against the pickup truck market demographic.

F150EV will be a small portion of the pickup market and is made even smaller by the higher cost for EV vs. ICE version.  Nice Ford makes them but it is to be expected to have a limited market especially this early in EV adoption.",2024-10-31,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"So I'm absolutely in the minority on this matter and I do not give a shit. I think the CyberTruck is the coolest looking, most out-of-the-box, and boldest design of a car in YEARS. 

In an age where we have so many black, white and grey copy and paste, cookie cutter vehicles on the road, the CyberTruck is honestly such a breath of fresh air. Say what you want about Elon Musk but you have to give him credit for taking a design risk and seeing it through, aesthetics be damned. 

I think the CyberTruck is one of those cars that's not going to get appreciated until another maybe 10-15, maybe even 20 years from now for being, as I said above, bold and not among the cookie cutter mold. I genuinely cannot think of the last time a car had this much of an impact on society solely because of the way it looks. I may get some hate for this, but I feel like the CyberTruck is the modern PT Cruiser in terms of how it's being received looks-wise, but the PT Cruiser is going through something of a renaissance now that time has passed and people realized what Chrysler was doing at the time. 

I think that about does it for me on the matter, but I'm definitely a fan of the CyberTruck, have had the pleasure of seeing a few of them around, and I always tip my cap to the drivers for not being afraid of the ridicule they'll absolutely be getting because everyone doesn't realize yet how cool that truck is.

‚Äú
Hello Everyone,

Earlier this week, we announced pricing increases that broke the trust we have worked to build with you. Since originally setting our pricing structure, and most especially in recent months, a lot has changed. The costs of the components and materials that go into building our vehicles have risen considerably. Everything from semiconductors to sheet metal to seats has become more expensive and with this we have seen average new vehicle pricing across the U.S. rise more than 30% since 2018. Given our build lead up times, we need to plan production costs not only for today, but also for the future.

As we worked to update pricing to reflect these cost increases, we wrongly decided to make these changes apply to all future deliveries, including pre-existing configured preorders. We failed to appreciate how you viewed your configuration as price locked, and we wrongly assumed the announced Dual-Motor and Standard battery pack would provide configurations that would deliver price points similar to your original configuration. While this was the logic, it was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian.

We also didn‚Äôt manage communications well. We didn‚Äôt give you enough insight into what was driving these decisions. The most important aspect of what we are building is our relationship with all of you. As we demonstrated earlier this week, trust is hard to build and easy to break. In speaking with many of you over the last two days, I fully realize and acknowledge how upset many of you felt. I have made a lot of mistakes since starting Rivian more than 12 years ago, but this one has been the most painful. I am truly sorry and committed to rebuilding your trust.

One of the things we talk about a lot internally is that we will make mistakes ‚Äì it‚Äôs part of building something complex. The key is to learn from them and address them when they are made. It is how we grow. We made a mistake in how we approached our pricing changes, and what is important now is that we fix it.

For anyone with a Rivian preorder as of the March 1 pricing announcement, your original configured price will be honored. If you canceled your preorder on or after March 1 and would like to reinstate it, we will restore your original configuration, pricing and delivery timing. Our team will be sending an email in the next few days with more details.

Regarding our updated pricing for future preorders, the introduction of our Dual-Motor configuration and Standard battery pack has been designed to enable us to maintain lower starting prices while adjusting the pricing of the Quad-Motor and larger battery packs to reflect rising costs. Building a durable business is core to the continued impact we can deliver as a company. We are focused on building a brand and products that will continue to scale to different vehicle sizes, use cases, price points and markets ‚Äì this growth will only be possible with your support and continued feedback.

Thank you for the personal notes and discussions I had with so many of you. Your feedback makes us better.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"So how much does one save on fuel a year ?

A regular F-150 gets what, 17 mpg? Someone driving 80 miles a work day , would use 5 gallons of gas a day.  Cost of fuel is maybe $2.75 post pandemic?  So that's $13.75 of fuel cost a day for someone that has a solid commute. 

How many kwh will someone use for 80 mile commute day in just announced vehicle?  50 khw per day?

So in some states, incremental electricity is what? $0.20/khw? ball park? (I know its higher in north east states like NY / CT).  So this person that uses 50 kwh a day would pay $10.00.

So someone would say $3.75 a day in fuel ($13.75 - $10.00); x 300 working days = $1,125 a year, before considering casual driving on weekends?

Only real difference is that the outer ""rain slick"", or whatever you want to call it, appears to be darker in the customer images, and ""looser"", but that might be attributed to the fact that they put it together in the rain and don't have it all secured and such.

- bed looks smaller? Not sure. Actually it might be the same size but now the top part covers part of the bed so from above it looks smaller.
- no door handles? There is something on the b/c pillar that looks new. Could be to open the door.
- inside side of bed has holes for pins. Similar to what Rivian has for modular attachments.
- charge port has been moved. It‚Äôs no longer on the side panel but maybe on the black frame above the wheel. There is a cut in that area.
- tow hitch is visible
- 3 small amber lights in the front are new
- marble dash look is now gone

It‚Äôs EASY to reach 240 miles of range with the Lightning if you‚Äôre not on the interstate or, *driving up a mountain* in which case, yeah. But the ‚Äú40 miles of power‚Äù claim is nonsense. One, it‚Äôs not really clear when the truck says 40 miles, and two, he doesn‚Äôt *actually* only have 40 miles of range left. He probably has 40 miles of range if he keeps driving higher up the mountain past his parents‚Äô house. But in reality, he‚Äôs going to have WAY more than that, because he‚Äôs going to be going downhill on the way back, but the truck doesn‚Äôt magically know that.

Complete nonsense, misleading garbage.

>EREVs. Those plug-in hybrids can lengthen a vehicle‚Äôs driving distance to as much as 700 miles by adding a small internal combustion engine that doesn‚Äôt drive the wheels and only acts as an onboard generator to recharge the battery.

The most famous EREV doesn‚Äôt meet this definition.

>We are looking at getting a trailer for my wife‚Äôs business and there‚Äôs just no way because that would cut the range in half,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI absolutely would never go full EV again.‚Äù

Sounds like someone who just didn‚Äôt do basically any research at all and who has a relatively uncommon use case that doesn‚Äôt work that well. He also bought the smallest battery EV truck, by far. Genius. We should totally listen to him and base an entire article around his experience.",2025-02-05,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"Tesla deserves credit for adapting to the sales performance of the CyberTruck. Not many automakers would have been able to respond to 2M orders and 38K sales (2% conversion). Tesla, to their credit, did a reality check, and bit the bullet and split production of the MY in Fremont and moved a bunch of that production to Texas. With the recent efforts to maybe make 'new Teslas, robotaxis, etc' in Texas, they should be able to improve the utilization of the factory. In the near-term they can move some CTs with free lifetime charging and the $7500 rebates until those go away. Hard to imagine how much more difficult the sales will become when the rebate ends. By then, the 'new vehicles' might begin to show some demand to make up the difference.

Between Fremont and Shanghai, Tesla can make about 2M vehicles. It remains to be seen whether world wide demand can fill the plants (2024 was < 1.8M vehicles). This ignores the production at Berlin and Texas. I would imagine those investments were made when Elon was keen to move the HQ and had forecast Tesla building 20M cars by 2030. New smaller cars and the autonomy revolution can help a lot if they materialize. Fundamentally, poor plant utilization undermines margins.",2025-03-18,reddit

I wouldn't want to cover a product that is, basically, a beta product.

The CT has a long road before it's really considered an ""Official"" release.

GMC Hummer EV,"The Electric Hummer with Crab Walk mode oh man! What a fun truck that would turn out to be one day! 

The idea is with Crab Walk mode you could theoretically design car ports on the sides of larger ships/transportation vehicles that could deploy hummers engaged in Crab Mode versus needing to be reversed and come out the rear of a trailer or drop plane, you could instead have a garage drop box that could offer a hummer to drive sideways into a port that was the same shape of the vehicle and wouldn't open but could be pushed in using the Hummer while engaged in Crab Mode, think camo garage you no longer need a full drive way and seeable roads that lead up to the entrance of a bunker.

Crab Mode drive sideways into a slot along a wall and suddenly it opens and you Crab Walk on in and the door shuts, not a standard issue garage door but the Hummer EV isn't a standard issue vehicle and so should the ideas on how to approach using it in a military aspect. You can probably design something that could fit multiple hummer's along a wall side and they all engage Crab Walk and can be drive out instantly on both sides of an enclosed trailer, could even fit in 4 at a time if the floors elevated and offered multilevel storage, you could hypothetically launch four complete Hummers engaged in Crab Walk mode almost instantaneously with full teams and gear loaded and ready if you launched them from the sides of a trailer instead of the rear where you have to drop one at a time, with Crab Mode and fast elevator garage lift system you could even just drop the walls and turn them into ramps that could then be used to crab walk down over the other hummer as it's using the bottom half of the wall as a ramp to do the same.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"The Lightning needs a refresh because the things that make an electric car great is outdated or undersized. 

I love my F150 Hybrid, that was my gateway to the Lightning. After a month with the Lightning, I felt the range was lacking. I didn't expect to get to the stated range, but I got way worse especially when I only charged to 80-85%. While my Model Y usually come in about 40 or so miles under the stated range, my Lightning came in almost 100 miles under the stated range. I got about 120ish miles on an between 10-80% charge (I found myself at a Charging Station a lot for a quick charge at the end of the day). It's enough but it doesn't leave my with enough buffer at times, but the overall range made it hard to do any light road trips on the weekends.

Also I see a lot of folks talking about them producing the overpriced model, and while I agree to some extent, their Platinum Lighting sucks. They had that ugly ass grayish blue for the longest time, and now they have this white/black combo. I felt like it the interior was a massive downgrade compared to the hybrid I was coming from and I accepted that it would be inferior when upgrading. 

I wanted to like the Lightning, but on paper and all the reviews I'm reading about the Sierra EV is basically what I want in a Lighting. If they can give me a regular F150 Platinum interior with roughly 400 miles of stated range so I can bump the usable range closer to 225 miles daily and have a truck that I can take to Tahoe or Yosemite without having to charge both ways. I'd consider getting it again. But it desperately needs a refresh, I wanted to like it because it's the only EV truck that's a traditional design so I can convert it to a work truck if I had to. But the overall experience is that a Rivian R1T is much nicer (but bed size and utility doesn't suit my needs), The Sierra means I can't plop a traditional lumber rack on it when I need. The Cybertruck is just a pass.

The Lightning legitimately could be good, and that's worst than just being a bad product. Range and interior quality and design is what kills it because you can get a gas/hybrid F150 and if we're comparing the Platinum (before they downgraded that and introduced the Platinum Plus) between the gas and the EV, the gasser was much nicer in every way even though they were suppose to be the same.",2024-10-31,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"The article is saying that they finished the entire reservation list for the new trim level in 9 days because a guy in Texas ordered it in July and got his invite already. Now, Tesla normally delivers to the closest customers first, and since the truck is made in Texas, I would take that to mean they've exhausted their Texas reservation list at most.

The Cybertruck might be suffering the same fate as the Hummer H2 (and to a lesser extent the H3). The public hate for it is so loud that even most of the people who want it won't order it because of what other people will think of them. A lot of people drive vehicles to project an image, and if that image isn't cool then they won't buy it. So, I have no doubt they're having trouble converting reservations, but I'm not convinced it's quite as bad as this article suggests. 

If the Truck came in at its original price, I'm sure they'd convert a lot more reservations because at that price it's not only one of the cheapest EVs on the market, it's one of the cheapest large trucks on the market. People will buy anything if it's cheap enough (ex. Vinfast).",2024-10-14,reddit

Rivian R1T,"The charger issue could your home electrical wiring or the settings in the charger itself. If your wiring is not up to spec it you will have to much resistance due to the gauge size of wires in the house and the charger will turn off. It‚Äôs possible you need to lower your app rating in the truck (there is a setting in the charger screen) for now until you figure out the issue. If you lower the amps in the truck setting and it works then it‚Äôs very possible the house wiring. If it‚Äôs the house there is no need to wait till Jan 29th. 
Trying this will at least give you some confidence by the time the appointment comes around.

The F-150 gets 310 range and nobody complains.  When you add the Tesla network, then its a non-issue.

When you look at regular trucks, the gas tanks normally have 24 gallons (Silverado 1500).  The range under perfect conditions would be around 500 miles.  Under normal conditions, you'll probably get 380 miles (70mph, hills, acceleration, running AC, etc).  When you tow heavy stuff, cut that in half for 190 miles.

GMC Hummer EV,"Then again the energy used burning 5 gallons of gas could power 5-10 homes for a day.

To calculate the energy content in 5 gallons of gasoline, we need to know the energy content per gallon of gasoline and then convert it to both British thermal units (BTU) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).

1. **Energy Content of Gasoline:** A gallon of gasoline typically contains about 114,000 BTU of energy. 

2. **Energy in 5 Gallons of Gasoline in BTU:** To find the total energy content in BTUs, we multiply the energy per gallon by 5:
   \[ 114,000 \text{ BTU/gallon} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = 570,000 \text{ BTU} \]

3. **Converting BTU to kWh:** To convert BTUs to kWh, we use the conversion factor where 1 kWh is equivalent to 3,412 BTU. So, the energy in kWh for 5 gallons of gasoline is:
   \[ \frac{570,000 \text{ BTU}}{3,412 \text{ BTU/kWh}} \approx 167 \text{ kWh} \]

Therefore, 5 gallons of gasoline contain approximately 570,000 BTU or about 167 kWh of energy. This calculation provides a rough estimate, as the actual energy content can vary slightly based on the specific formulation of the gasoline.",2023-12-09,reddit

Chevy Silverado EV,"There's a few reasons.  

The first is to hold public interest.  Why do you think there's Pepsi ads that just say 'Pepsi' and nothing else?  Why do companies pay millions to plaster their logo everywhere?  Not even an ad, just a logo?  To keep themselves in your mind.  

The reason for this is twofold.  The first is more for low and mid range cars- so when it's time to get a car, you think of that company.  Hopefully with a positive impression.  Maybe 3-4 months down the road you'll need a car and remember that superbowl ad with the flashy EV.  

The second is reinforcement.  This is more for luxury cars.  Most luxury car ads aren't actually to sell cars- they are to reinforce the purchase decision of someone who's either already planning to buy, or has recently ordered.  That person WANTS to see that they just made the right choice, and the ad gives them exactly what they want--  you chose right, this car has the best technology and whatever.  

Then of course is the simple fact that they have the ad budget and aren't going to NOT spend it.  If they advertise ICE cars they will seem outdated (since everyone else is pushing EVs).  So they spend it.  

And let's not forget a lot of people will go to a dealer looking for an EV and get talked into an ICE car or hybrid.",2022-10-31,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"They appear to be Ford Raptor numbers, which seems to be the competition...  A high end ""lifestyle"" pickup segment product.

That's really *not that bad* for a truck that's 100K.  (Which is also right where the Raptor sits... And way more sales than the Ram TRX)

But, rather obviously, that's not a mass market pickup truck, and Tesla would I'm sure like to sell these as more of a mass market vehicle.  But that likely means getting the price for at least a dual motor variant to probably $60K.

The real question is what the production cost of the CT is.  Is Tesla making $50K for every sale?  Or $20K?  Or less?

I think that Tesla would sell these things (after the normal production ramp-up shitshow) quite well at a price tag that is actually competitive with other mass market trucks, but the current price tag is just too damn high.",2025-01-02,reddit

They only made it 86 miles with 9% left. That means every hour & a half. You then have to stop and charge for longer than you drove to get it back to 100% battery. So on a day with a temp of 80* f, and a empty trailer they got to go 86 miles. Just think if the weather is super hot, or cold. The battery life will suffer. So your range will be reduced. Then add another 2,000lbs in weight once you load you sxs, and normal gear. So again you would get even less road time.. Game changer. Hell no unless you are talking about how it's now going to take a full day to go 400 miles. Like I have said before. It's good at everything but being a truck. Hard pass.

Tesla Cybertruck,"They were advertised as ""cheap"" with an impressive range. Instead they are expensive with middling range.

At best it's a niche product for posers and edgelords.

Tesla Cybertruck,"They're hot garbage, that's why.  But there are other reasons.

Truckbros want to be able to personalize their trucks: not easily done with a Cyberjunk.  You can paint it - thus covering up one of its greater unique features, the stainless skin.  You can fly your Confederate/Traitor flag from it, but that's not exactly distinctive.  And uh...that's about it.  Is anyone building a lift kit for these things?  Or bolting a loud exhaust?

Actually I would love to market extra-loud exhausts for Cyberjunks; parting fools from their money is its own reward, multiplying by zero is just icing on the cake.

They're actually kind of fragile and piss-poor at a lot of the Big Boi Truck posing that actual trucks do.  Fording streams, rolling coal, surviving car washes - Cyberjunks aren't proven winners at these feats.

And of course Tesla's association with its alt-right Totally Not A Nazi Service Dodging Illegal Immigrant CEO isn't improving matters.  It might win with MAGAts who have already blinded their eyes to their Dear Leader's many failings, what's one more, right?

2025 is shaping up to be a hard year for Tesla. Musk's reputation is not in the least bit useful. Beyond that 2025 is the year that mass market affordable EVs arrive in both the EU and US that spells competition and falling sales. Competition cuts profit margins of course but given that the Models 3 and Y sold so well while there was a dearth of EVs to be had they are over represented on the roads. At least some potential buyers will select a different EV to avoid being lost in sea of sameness that is Tesla.

GMC Hummer EV,"This is not a good thing.

That means the center of gravity is high enough to allow a strong enough rotation torque on the truck to bring the front wheels off the ground. 

It also means the center of gravity is high enough to where the truck will be easy to roll. 

One of the advantages of evs is the skateboard design that puts the center of gravity really low between the wheels. It's nearly impossible to roll a Tesla. With the Hummer, the battery pack is so big, it is double stacked. Bringing the center of gravity up. That's on top of the ground clearance. I wonder if the battery pack is high enough where it can roll. That's kind of dangerous on a 9000lb truck that can do 0-60 in 3ish seconds.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"This is not surprising.   

The crash protection in an F150 was already certified.  The brakes were certified, etc.   

Making a car electric is not as hard as making a car that will pass standards.   90% of the F150 passed standards, it only has to re-certify with the new bits.   The Cybertruck has to certify the whole truck.     

Electric motors have been around a long time.  Mosfets have been around 50 years.      Sure, the batteries for this new crop of EV were lab stuff 30 years ago, but Ford simply bought the batteries, like Tesla did up until a couple years ago.  

The rate of new car manufacturers coming to market has been slowing down since 100 years ago when there were quite a few.   It slows as the regulations on cars get stricter.    If it were easy to make a new car, we'd have more new cars.      This makes me mistrustful of these new electric car makers.  They have significant hurdles way beyond being electric.   

Kudos to Tesla for being able to do it at all.   That was only done with significant investment from an eccentric billionaire who has since made his money back on the stock.       Maybe Rivian, Ride, Lucid, etc. can do it to with their huge stock valuations, but maybe they can't, like Elio, who was clever in trying to skirt the rules by making a much easier to certify motorcycle, but even they haven't gotten past making a handful of cars.",2022-05-27,reddit

GMC Hummer EV,"This is still in very optimal conditions likely prepped track conditions.  So from that respect it still doesn't reflect real world driving experience.  

Some of these cars will be squirrely as hell on the road trying to get anywhere near these numbers while others will be much more planted and easier to repeat.  Traction will be a bigger issue than power, whether it's EV or ICE, modern cars are all kinda leaning on the fact that they can leverage ABS and TC type functions to just throw GOBS of power out and let the car keep things in line.  

Can you imagine these cars without those functions at work?  It would be the old days where only folks who want the rush, and risk, of big power and questionable traction would drive these things.

But what that means is that as the traction situation improves, ABS and TC can stop getting involved and let you maximize all that power, so you can kinda cheat the list there.  Make a car that will NEVER be anywhere near able to use all the power it can make unless it's on a very well treated race track and then say 'well it does 0-60 or 5-60 in XX seconds'.  Sure...if you only ever drive on a drag strip.  Otherwise there are more important factors...like AWD really shining in less than perfect road conditions.

But consider most EV's have a much smaller battery, most people charge at home, and most people aren't charging from 0-100%.  Those are 3 big factors that make this article's scenario unlikely.

A few more things to consider: Many new EV's come with a free subscription for DC charging (limited use).  Most people are only utilizing DC charging 1-2 times on a road trip (unless you are driving cross country or something).

This is like a worst case scenario being reported in this article.  I personally pay around $15 to fully charge my EV when charging at home.  I use a DC fast charger once every two months or so and it's currently free as a limited subscription with my lease.",2022-11-17,reddit

Nothing can be ignored.

That's not to say that getting to production *isn't* hard, but it's not a race. You don't cross the finish line, throw your hands up and drink some gatorade, production is just another set of challenges that repeat endlessly even when you're a mature company, or you die.",2023-05-18,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning Sales:October 2023:           3712 unitsNovember 2023:      4400 unitsMonth over month increase:  688 unitsThis is 18.5% growth from October 2023 to November 2023.  Good to see some growth, but its a trivial amount due to the low volume they are generating.  Ford's initial plans were to be producing 12,500 units per month by now, but they recently announced they are scaling way back to focus on gas/electric hybrids, which are even more expensive to build and maintain.

November 2022:     2200 unitsNovember 2023:     4400 unitsThis is an increase of 2200 units from the prior year November sales. This is a ""doubling"", but it took them 12 months to get this meager monthly volume increase of just 2200 units more per month!.

Chevy Silverado EV,"Thoughts:

Some GM engineer discovered some dusty GM feature book from 20 years ago and decided to get his promotion by bringing up 4 wheel steering and a midgate during a product meeting- both are previous GM features that have total diehards but haven't been revived since.

1. It's an avalanche. The 60/40 split midgate is awesome. If I recall correctly the previous avalanche midgate was a full bench, so you couldn't have someone in the back at all. This configuration allows for 8ft lumber + someone to sit in back. 

2. The ""E"" branding is so weird.

3. Pricing: I suppose it's fine. Very competitive with the lightning and truthfully I think the Silverado is a more compelling product.

4. I also think it looks good. The Silverado is obviously geared for non-truck people. The Sierra variant is absolutely being styled for traditional truck buyers- this is where GM having two seperate truck nameplates is going to be BIG, whereas before Silverado/Sierra buyers were the same people with different preferences.

You can really see the advantage that a dedicated EV platform (Hummer/Silverado EV) has over a retrofitted ICE (Lightning), and I'm sure driving dynamics will match as well.

I really think they should have just called it the avalanche. I get that Silverado is a recognizable nameplate, and also that ""Avalanche"" is literally a natural disaster, but GM is reviving names for their EVs anyways (Hummer, Buick Electra)

I'm also extremely curious how GM estimated their range values. Given that the RST is quoted at 400 miles with the massive 24"" rims, you could seriously expect a Silverado with a smaller wheel size (like the steelies on the WT) to do double-digit % better. Though if they're smart they'll downsize the packs rather than push for 400+ (there's no point when you already offer 100 more miles than the competition).

Having the RST trim be the top for the Silverado is odd- given that RST is traditionally below LTZ and High Country for the ICE Silverados. I wonder if they'd prefer to get rid of the LTZ/HC to uplevel them to Sierras instead. If they can avoid losing people in transition to the Lightning Platinum trim it would save GM a lot of money in terms of packaging.",2022-01-05,reddit

I'll be brief, I believe they are good products and I made this decision because I believe it now stands for the wrong thing. Hope my Tesla goes to someone else instead of them buying new. Better to act on your convictions than to not act at all.

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

I was looking for something similar to Tesla. I mainly wanted the regen and software to be similar. And from a Tesla owners perspective, the Rivian is very similar, which is great! The regen is even stronger and adjustable.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

Tesla Cybertruck,"Turns out when you significantly underdeliver on range while significantly increasing the price, your customer base is much smaller than anticipated. 

Tesla needs to bring out the RWD model and reduce all trim level pricing by $15-$20k if they want to produce high volumes. Obviously you only want to do that after exhausting initial demand. 

I think the same could be said for the Lightning. If the price had stayed around $40K for the entry model, I have no doubt that the volumes would be triple what they are now. (They would also need to lower the pricing of their other trim levels.) Hell, right now they aren‚Äôt even offering the entry model! With battery cost contouring to fall, I‚Äôm wondering why Ford can‚Äôt reduce the price even further. To really reduce the price, they need a ground up design that is now years away.",2024-12-03,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"Two things

- Elon wasn‚Äôt full MAGA when most of the reservations happened
- We were quoted $40K for a base model and $50K for a solid dual motor middle tier with a great amount of range and finally a $70K model with 500 miles of range

What we got was a $80K Dual Motor model and a $100K performance model that failed to reach the promised 500 mile range figures. 

On top of that Elon bought twitter and started promoting divisive rhetoric, broke his promise about political neutrality, revealed himself to be a full on Trumpist sycophant and took a central role in the Trump administrations illegal efforts to destroy essential institutions within the US government. He‚Äôs also endorsed the Nationalist German AFD party in Germany and voiced support for cancelling programs that promote electric vehicles and EV infrastructure.",2025-03-30,reddit

Rivian opened pre-orders in 2018 for $67.5k with planned deliveries in 2020. They started deliveries in 22/23 at the promised price.

Chevy Silverado EV,"Two things:

First, all marketing and promotional materials for this vehicle have, so far, acted as if it is an Avalanche that they just happen to be calling a Silverado.  To make the mid-gate completely unavailable in the WT trims (of which I presume there are 4) is utterly baffling to me.  I don't get it at all.  Why even offer a Silverado EV model that doesn't have it?  I just don't get the logic there.

Second, they are absolutely stoned out of their minds if they think it's reasonable to have the 3WT cost only about $5k less than the 4WT (a price drop of 6.25% down from $80k) while taking a 100 mile range hit (a drop of 22.2% down from 450 miles).  I get it that it's not just the range that is different between the two, and it's not just the range that gives the 4WT its worth, but that's downright insulting to me.  Why even bother offering a 3WT if you're gonna give people 100 more miles of range for just $5k more?  Do they even want to sell 3WTs?",2023-06-26,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"Understandably, this place is filled with Tesla haters. But Tesla continues to do things that no one else is. Keep in mind that these missed deadlines are on projects much bigger and more complicated than anybody else is taking on. And they continually make huge progress. 

Let‚Äôs review what they have already currently accomplished:

- most efficient batteries (no other EV has as much range while producing as much acceleration - compare the EV6 to model 3 trim levels
- easily the best driver assist software anybody can buy (and ongoing RAPID progress) - compare to GM, Ford, etc. check a recent YouTube video on the performance
- most widespread and actually functioning charging network (the other chargers are always breaking)
- easily the best infotainment software - see how smooth it operates and intuitive with a screen compared to other software efforts from automakers
- they sell the best selling CAR (not just EV) in the world. Model Y sells more than any other. 

Tesla is in the EV lead position and their lead continues to grow. The next EV they release will be an affordable $25k car and will eliminate any competition (GM, VW, Ford, Toyota, Honda will all struggle to stay in business) because no one else will be able to make an affordable economy EV without losing tons of money per car. 

Rest assured, the Cybertruck will come out and sell at least decently well. And be a reminder that they are here to stay and win.

Tesla Cybertruck,"We own a cybertruck. We have owned model X and we still own a RAM 1500.

The Cybertruck and other EV trucks have redefined what the basic features of a truck are. A truck was a thing that could seat 5, had a good size bed, could tow stuff, (and for some people do offroading, but I didn't care about that). Now we add to that... power for tools, fridge, 14-50 for the RV, and home backup... as well as driver assist (autopilot and equivalent), fast acceleration, all wheel steering (maneuverable), steer by wire, efficiency of a Prius, and tow features like automatic trailer weight and tongue weight estimation. Note that the Cybertruck doesn't have every feature listed above, but it and a few other EV trucks have almost all those features.

As far as I can tell nobody buys a Cybertruck because of steer by wire or all wheel steering. However, once you have driven it for a week, every other vehicle is just undrivable. It makes a much bigger difference than power steering, for example. When you see <insert name of famous person> buying their second cybertruck to keep at their second home because they can't stand to drive any of their other dozen cars... I think the reason is steer by wire. It takes a week to get used to it but now I hate everything else.

Now, as to the question of why the Cybertruck compared to other EV trucks/SUVs. We like the Rivians, we like their CEO. However there were issues for us... the autopilot wasn't as good, the nearest service center is an hour away, the Rivians don't get to use all the superchargers (only the ones you don't need to use anyway) so going for example from Denver to Las Vegas via Bryce Canyon etc is more limiting even with the access that Rivians have. Also the Rivians are smaller. These were big things for us in particular and might not be for you. The other EV trucks are still good, as far as I can tell Cybertruck owners aren't extreme fans who believe every other EV truck is bad.

Looks: you are welcome to like it or hate it, personally I don't care so much but it has grown on me.

The haters: in my experience most haters are people who have spent $50k modifying their subaru. The modified subaru is an ""SUV"" that is much worse on every spec (particularly sports and utility) than the Cybertruck, but I guess people who spend $50k on modifying their vehicle have very particular tastes. Compare to a random Subaru SUV on acceleration, efficiency, towing capacity, cargo space, turn radius, ground clearance and it only wins on price (and even then only if you don't spend too much on modifications). Electric trucks make me laugh when I hear the term SUV applied to a vehicle that isn't sporty or utility. I don't hate SUVs or drivers of SUVs, just the term SUV.
The haters also tend to be on the extremes of politics (both left and right). Being in Colorado we tend to get all sorts of people, but they are usually not too intolerant.

The buyers make a strange collection of people. Some bought to flip, some bought to try to make money on YouTube and have had to do all kinds of crazy things and say all kinds of crazy things to get clicks. There are MAGAs, Kennedy fans, libertarians, preppers, liberals who are owners... but the silent (and growing) majority are normal people who just want the best vehicle for their needs.

We've used our Cybertruck to tow our Jeep through Helene (the 12v died in our 4xe), to power tools and our RV, to tow stuff around town, to carry a basement's worth of insulation, to go across country, etc. We only had a short power outage with Helene in Eastern TN but we're ready. Currently back in CO we're building a 2-level ski rack into the truck (just under the tonneau) for 12 pairs of skis with boot warmer underneath connected to the 110v outlet. we have a powered cooler and are tempted to chuck in a Keurig, microwave, electric grill for the best start to ski days. Almost all of the above can be done by other EV trucks, although the steering of the Cybertruck is great for the mountain roads we hit.",2024-10-14,reddit

Rivian R1T,"Well if the CFO is right they should be on spot to be at gross profit, not profitable by Q4. TBH after having one for 2 years, if mine was totaled today I would be ordering a new one with the insurance payout same day. With over 75,000 vehicles out on American roads and a fully operational manufacturing plant, I think bankruptcy is pretty far from the next thing for Rivian.. Amazon Owning 2 billion of the company would likely mean a potential influx of cash if they need 2 more quarters to get R2 out. TESLA for example had 10 billion in debt and 2 billion in cash in 2017.

Today Rivian has 4.4 billion in debt and 9.8 billion in cash. The next steps when they run out of cash is not bankruptcy it would be to enter into debt portfolios leveraged by their companies assets to keep afloat until R2. That 4.4 billion in debt is the Georgia plant though so that will be a net asset at completion, the 9.8 also excludes the 1.5 billion raised in Q4 of last year. So they are really at 11.3 billion.... A much better place then even Tesla was 6 years ago.

So in short I think if the sweet kiss of death comes I have 3 more years until it does. And even then they will have 200k+ vehicles on the road and a portfolio of assets that likely mean they get gobbled up not dissolved. Could be wrong.


The news is always bad if you arent comparing it to the other data points available. Is Rivian profitable no. Is Rivian as safe a bet as a Ford or a VW. No. Is Rivian likely to go bankrupt in 2024... No.

Also remember GM and Chrysler/Dodge already went bankrupt in the last 15 years bankruptcy also doesn't mean you disappear it likely in this case means restructuring.

Right now most analysts have Rivian as a neutral.
Also I'm interested to see how this att pilot goes, they are buying an untold number of R1's and EDVs

Rivian R1T,"Well, before jumping on the bash Rivian bandwagon, let's look at this from their perspective. I understand if you're dragging around the extra weight of a portion of the battery you can't use, you might find it frustrating, but consider this....   
  
Rivian's cost of purchasing, inventorying and scheduling the assembly line for multiple battery sizes would cost Rivian more per unit (the golden rule => higher volume = lower cost). Rivian chose a single standard size, larger battery, and passed the savings along to those that didn't want the up-front additional cost. When they offer a purchase option for that extra capacity - at a reasonable price - it seems like everyone should be happy. 

You don't have to buy the extra capacity. But your vehicle just went up in value. The purchase option will add to the resale value - offering the next owner the option to purchase that extra capacity - if they ever want it.

I bought the Dual Std, so I don't have the same dilemma. But the worst case  scenario would have been if Rivian did not offer the customer the option to purchase that extra capacity / range, right?",2025-03-04,reddit

Rivian R1T,"When are we going to just admit that when it comes to road trips that span over 8 hours one way, the EV of today are not as time-efficient as traditional fuel cars, especially in challenging weather and road conditions? 

It takes around 1.5 hours per 8 hours of driving to charge most EV vs. about 10 minutes for traditional fuel cars. It shouldn‚Äôt even be a debate. 

If you‚Äôre a very frequent 8+ hour road tripping person, an EV may not be the best choice just yet, even a Tesla which has a great charging curve and thermals management. 

But for people whose main use is local daily commutes (and occasional road trips) and have access to cheap chargers, however, EV is just a great way to get around! 

I have test driven the Model X and the R1S G2 (two competing EV), and Rivian truly shines bright given it still retains the basic safety features absent in Tesla (BSM, RCTA, parking sensors, surround 360 camera), the seating comfort, and the overall build quality. Their UI is also coming along nicely and gear guard etc. useful gimmicks are now competing closely with Tesla. The Tesla chargers are also open to Rivian, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they replace their onboard charging port with NACS. So even that‚Äôs a wash. 

The only two redeeming qualities Tesla has today are charging curve / thermals (that Kyle complained about in the Rivian), and well, full self driving, for those who care (it‚Äôs indeed a feat of engineering IMHO). But otherwise, it‚Äôs Rivian‚Äôs game to lose now.",2024-11-25,reddit

Drove around for almost 30 minutes looking for the charge stations because the location on the map was wrong for the first 2 we tried.   

Finally found them,  mall had 4-5 free ones, all full with a line of people waiting to use them. Found some non-free Go chargers with an empty spot.  Downloaded the app, about 5 minutes of registering and adding payment info, only to get asked the cars VIN (why??!?), which it said it didn't recognize. Several minutes struggling with that and realized there is a way to skip that part and finally ready to charge, so we thought.   Then we had to identify the charger, there was a label on it, but that label didn't show up in the app search, finally we noticed there was an asset ID shown on the status screen,  finally we found the charger in the app!   Tried to activate charging,  charger throws an error.   

I got in the car and said screw it, we don't have to plug in to get home, we've got a half tank of gas, and moved the car to a regular parking spot.  And after shopping that's exactly what we did, we drove home in Sport mode, and between going down the pseudo mountain and a decent amount of traffic resulting in a lot of regen, we got home with 78% charge.

There were several other people sitting in their cars waiting for enough charge to drive home,  and several cars waiting in line for available spots.",2023-12-23,reddit

Elon going heavy on the no mirrors thing tells me the patent tesla filed to join two different glass compositions will play a big role in heads up displays.

Tesla Cybertruck,"Wow is that a shit article.

Anyway, in reddit fashion, respond to the headline:

* Tesla massively missed their own own launch specs & Pricing.
   * People were expecting a 500+ mile range, 14000lb towing, 3500lb payload cybertruck for $70k, and got a 320 mile range, 11000lb towing, 2500lb towing cybertruck for $100k
   * Early prototypes had 6 seats. Only a 5 seat version made it to production.
   * The final design includes things like windscreen wiper, wing mirrors, larger bumpers, so does not look quite a futuristic as the concept.
* Tesla were years late to market compared to what was expected
   * Late 2021 production was planned, but production started 2 years late in Nov 2023.
   * It is now 2025 and the cheapest RWD version is still not available.
   * Tesla were expected to be first to market (other than high priced Rivian), but when by the time they hit the market, there was lots of coemption in the space.
* Economic conditions have changed.
   * People were a lot more willing to spend on EV's in the buoyant economic conditions' and high oil price environment of say late 2022
   * Auto industry as a whole has issues. Massive overproduction of high priced vehicles vs consumer demand in the current environment. Ram 1500, 2500,. 3500 all have 200+ days sales of cars on hand.
* $100 deposits turn out to be a poor metric of actual sales
* An international launch was expected, but currently the cybertruck is only available in north America
   * I live in a RHD market outside north America, and tesla still has a bunch of deposits from here, despite no serious word of RHD production.",2025-03-19,reddit

GMC Hummer EV,Wow you guys must not use that much electricity at your house.

Rivian R1T,"Wow, ya‚Äôll forgetting those of us who camp off grid.  All I need is 1-2kWh per day to offset vampire drain and what I consume from the outlets to cook and run tent HVAC.

Anything above 2kWh is additional range that will help me get home.

Currently when I camp off grid, I use on average 1-2% battery per day, so this will be a super useful option for that.  Over a week I lose almost 10-15% battery.  A product like this eliminates that loss and adds back, meaning I can go deeper in the country and still confidently get back.  

It‚Äôs almost like an electric Jerry can for off grid camping and overlanding.

Obviously not for regular charging, but common folks, stop hating the solar solution when so many of us with actual use cases will buy these!

All that said I am primarily looking at the GoSun EV solar charger that is a larger solar panel array and I think gets above 1.2kW charge rate.

That would be an annual run-rate of *approximately* 75k, for anyone out there doing the napkin math. Not terrible, but not great considering Ford had [just finished a facilities upgrade](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/08/01/ford-restarts-expanded-rouge-electric-vehicle-center--f-150-ligh.html) meant to allow them to hit that original 150k mark. 

I would not be surprised if a lot of this has to do with the impending IRA changes disqualifying the LFP-variant Lightning from tax incentives in the USA.",2023-12-11,reddit

>... The Energy Department in the spring proposed to eliminate the 6.67 multiplier while softening the impact with other changes. As a result, a Ford-150 Lightning would only be credited with 67.1 mpg, down from 237.7 mpg. But taken altogether, the Administration‚Äôs proposed revisions would in effect mandate that EVs make up 100% of new vehicles by 2032.

>Detroit auto makers would be slammed harder than foreign competitors by the regulatory changes because pick-ups and SUVs make up a larger share of their fleet sales. ‚ÄúThe average projected compliance cost per vehicle for the D3 is $2,151, while non-D3 auto manufacturers only see an increase of $546 per vehicle,‚Äù the Big Three recently told the Energy Department.

>They add that the proposed rule would ‚Äúdevalue‚Äù their EV investments. This gives away that complying with government mandates, not satisfying consumers, is their chief preoccupation. **GM‚Äôs strategy has been to produce just enough EV pick-ups to meet the Cafe standards. But under the Energy Department‚Äôs proposal, it could make more sense to pay the government penalties than to increase production of EVs that don‚Äôt sell.

GMC Hummer EV,"\* I am not a mathematician so please double check my numbers for those inclined.\*

As much as I disagree with the Hummer EV, the environmental tradeoff vs an H2 is enormous. 24kWh to travel 50 miles is the energy equivalent of using about 0.7 gallons of gas and actually appears to far exceed it's EPA rating of 47MPGe combined. Now, compare that to an ICE variant of the H2 which seems to average around 10mpg and we're talking about an \~85% decrease in energy use. 

In the end, it's far more energy than SHOULD be used, but converting these glutinous monsters over to electric is still a small win.",2022-11-13,reddit

GMC Hummer EV,"cost:    Cybertruck much cheaper than Hummer, Rivian cheaper as well

weight: Cybertruck lighter, Rivian in middle, Hummer huge and heavy

off-road gear: Hummer all the way, except for its size

in-cab features: Hummer has a bunch, Cybertruck will likely have the full Tesla experience

marketing: GM is bracketing with the cheapest long-range EV and the fanciest truck, just as they don't bother competing with Toyota and Honda in gas cars today. The hugely powerful Hummer is going to make a big media splash, so that seems ( even to me, a many-years truck owner who would never buy  a $40K truck, let alone $120K) like a smart play until they can get the Silverado done.

batteries: I am guessing they are held back by battery supply until the giant plants are up&running. So is Tesla, just at an order of magnitude more.

and- Audi Etron weighs 5600 lbs! Mustang weighs 4600lbs! Taycan is no Twiggy, either.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"good:

Fast - I smash hellcats to 100ft and can pull on most cars on the road with the instant power while they figure out the shift 

Spacious - I roll around with 2 crazy border collies all day

Towing - similar to fast, I can tow 8000# like I'm driving a Miata.

Cheap to travel if you're home charging, and Tesla's network opens up the darn near the entire country to travel.

It's basically a street spec f150

not so good -

Heat, towing, and general hard driving kills mileage - but it's never been a real issue for me besides lots of stops on road trips during which driving frugally doesn't really save much spark.

Charging on long trips is nearly impossible without a supercharger adapter.  For example all the DC fast chargers in Redding CA were tampered with or down on my first road trip, I used a destination charger for two hours to get to Chico's crowded fast chargers.

I paid more for my XLT than people are now paying for Lariats - not some much a problem as me being impulsive at the worst time.

I dunno why they advertise it leveled out then sell you a truck that's bitched forward substantially, and the decent lowering kit is 10% the price of the truck or your stuck with a rough riding eibach kit to lower.  I do not want to lift-level an EV, I wanted a true Lightning f150 like Brian's from the Racers Edge - but single cab long bed built to rip vs the goofy step side.

Then there are the europeans who are eternally confused. Let me clear it up for y'all. The USA has large, wide streets, and is gigantic. Oil was really cheap here for a long time and still is relatively speaking. So we built our society around the vehicle, and we didn't have the same restrictions that exist in europe like having to design around ancient cities with small streets. So we built our road network to allow nice large vehicles that allow a full family to ride around in total comfort. You would have done exactly the same thing if you lived here.

Rivian R1T,"i know exactly why they are doing this (inflation, supply chain, too much demand), but it doesn't help the sting of waiting 2-3 years, passing on other EVs, wanting to support a new company, only to find that they won't honor their pricing. this will cut down their backlog significantly, and boost profits near term, but in almost all other aspects this is a failure. Mainly of communication, which is unfortunately no surprise to anyone who follows the company. I think we all knew the pricing was too good to be true. And I think we probably would've been okay with some graduated pricing increases or loss of certain options, in exchange for some benefits like maybe free membership /subscriber benfits for a year or two or something. But the way this was done abruptly, and all at once, reads like poor management and leadership.

Personally, I think execs are sitting in the boardroom looking at their bleeding valuation, supply chain issues, with the competition coming hard and fast, and they are not comfortable with the situation, so probably a while ago they said ""axe some features, cut costs, raise prices, because we need to stay afloat, and we'll do damage control later."" Basically survival mode. I'm guessing they shopped around for more opportunities for big investment and came up dry. they want to build another factory and they need cash, its that simple. I think they could have found a better way though. and unfortunately, Rivian now has a definite pattern of not communicating with customers. In fact it appears that Rivian never once considered pre-order holders to be customers at all, despite taking their money and not paying any interest on it. 

I predict they will back-pedal a bit. not because they magically achieve higher rates of production, but just the optics. their employees are all over this sub and the forums. as soon as they see the fall out, we'll get a friendly email from RJ, like usual.",2022-03-02,reddit

It seems like the better move to me, and it shows in the specs. Even Ford has said they are bringing out a new lightning in 2025 with a ground up EV platform. The current F150 lightning is a lame duck and i'd be very surprised if a majority of reservation holders actually convert to sales. However, i do know that there is a large contingent of Ford fanboys out there who grew up in a ""Ford family"" and wouldn't buy anything else. Also, there seems to be a contingent of people who just want an EV truck at all costs as soon as possible, and they don't seem to care that its an ICE conversion. I don't understand why these people can't just wait 2-3 years and get something more modern but hey, if you absolutely must have an EV truck within 1-2 years and don't mind spending a huge amount of money on an ICE conversion vehicle that will be obsolete in a couple years, more power to you?",2022-02-03,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"initially it was over promising, under delivering, with way too high a price. I suspect if they hadnt chased rear steering when they saw what GM was doing the vehicle might have been cheaper.

but then musk went full redpill maga and gave a double facist salute at the presidential inauguration. combined that with the vehicle already kinda being a monument to his huberis and you've got a toxic product on your hand.

I think if they were cheaper and had fewer problems, they probably could have gotten more out the door before musk's behavior became a highly visible issue. but even at 80k, thats just rich person toy territory for a vehicle. and toys generally need to be cool",2025-03-18,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"its kinda amazing as many of the things have been built as have been. I think the delorean is a pretty reasonable comparison (stainless design, a bit weird for its time, mechanical issues, underperformed vs what was promised, came in nearly twice the price as promised) and they only made around 9k of them. So far it looks like they've made double that number of the CTs. 

I suspect the combination of the price of the thing along with Musk's politics conflicting with that of most EV buyers is a near deathblow to these things. Cause if all the demand for them at 80k has already been expended, the CT's record setting sales numbers for an EV truck wont last long. If demand does fall off a cliff, it will be interesting to see if they keep making them or not. 

It would be interesting if they'd brought it in at around 60k after the federal tax incentive (which the 80k model does not currently qualify for).",2024-10-14,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"meh, with a torque vectoring awd, much superior weight distribution than a normal truck, and lower center of gravity, along with a variable suspension, it will outhandle any typical truck. you're literally just making up reasons to complain. You also didn't see how big the brake calipers were, combined with the large tires it should at least match the braking capabilities of other vehicles in it's class. The entire chassis was obviously designed to handle what the vehicle is meant to do, no it's not the same as LS swapping an enconomy low budget fwd car and leaving it stock elsewhere.

Chevy Silverado EV,"my first thoughts are that i like the exterior, but i want to see a mid trim LT version with a longer bed. it appears to have the best interior of anything I've seen this year... much better than the f150 lightning interior. the specs are good, the features and capability are good, except payload is pretty low (1200 pounds). towing capability is obviously good, how could it not be. efficiency isn't great, but i don't think anyone thought it would be incredibly efficient. it's a full size truck designed to work, tow and haul. if that isn't what you intend to do, then there are much more efficient vehicles out there for you to buy.

i absolutely love the mid gate. its one of those features that makes the vehicle incredibly versatile. i just hope they don't think they can get away with not offering a longer bed because of it.

pricing is about what I expected. we are 2-3 years out from actually being able to buy one, so that will give me plenty of time to save up. Overall, this is very likely going to be my next big vehicle purchase, so I'm pretty excited. my current Silverado is still going strong but I'm really looking forward to switching out for electric. I've had far less maintenance issues with my Chevy trucks (vs Ford) so that is the reason I'm sticking with GM. I like the Rivian but the bed is too small and i don't trust that vehicle with a thousand pounds of rocks in the bed. so right now, basically I'm just waiting for this truck to get mass produced. I'm in no rush but seeing the truck now is fun.",2022-01-05,reddit

Tesla Cybertruck,"the actual engineering, the elctrical system, drivetrain, the infotainment, sensors, self drive stuff... is all pretty remarkable and is why Tesla is as successful as it is.

the problem with Teslas is typically the car that is built around that stuff. shoddy build quality. interior feels cheap and is just some chairs, a screen, and then nothing. all the budget and attention goes into the engineering side, and then the actual car is an afterthought. this is true of the model 3, model y, etc. but at least those cars generally do well for their intended purpose. ive driven the model 3 and model y, and they are incredibly fun cars to drive. the model y is pretty spacious and even having the fake 3rd row can come in handy sometimes if you are shuttling some kids around. you can look past some of the build issues like rattling and whatnot because they at least function as the cars they're intended to be.

the cybertruck, realistically, is not good for doing truck things. the cabin isnt very spacious in the back seats. the stainless steel panels, while cool in concept, lead to some awful build quality and of course fingerprints and whatnot, which is why most people end up wrapping theirs.

aside from typical tesla build issues like panel alignment or rattling, the cybertrucks in particular have been plagued with defects and recalls. just a lot of red flags around all of it

as for the design, you have to admit its bold and there is absolutely nothing like it. it will draw eyeballs. im in the minority who thinks its cool (despite having other opinions about the practicality of the vehicle, its price point for what it actually offers, and how i feel about Musk, generally). many think it looks silly. its a matter of taste. but its definitely out there and thats admirable.

as one car review guy put it,  the cybertruck is a tech demo. as i see it, its a status symbol or political statement.

GMC Hummer EV,"this has been a problem for many other vehicles prior to this. My dad had to replace a headlight on his 2015 CX-5 and he was quoted nearly $3000. No damage, it just failed, and it was out of warranty. He played hardball with the dealer and they caved. of course, that was when LED headlights were just starting to be used more commonly. 

With the Hummer, it's because there is a chip in the light assembly that costs big money due to part shortages im sure. things like this are what cause manufacturers to move towards integrated solutions. Also the hummer is a high dollar halo car and that allows designers to take liberties knowing most people will never have to worry about how much a hummer tail light costs.

i'm 50/50 on the steel facade... the whole ""glue"" debacle is annoying and i'm sure they'll fix things... but now that two different areas have had the ""wrong glue"" used and potentially causing hazards is a bit frustrating to think of where else this could be an issue. living in a 4 seasons climate, there will be very hot and very cold days.. i just don't know if i can or should trust whatever the _wrong_ glue is.

end of the day, i'm just not interested in paying a bunch of money for a new vehicle that requires such a compromise. still in talks with them, and if they can line things up in a way that i'll enjoy trading vehicles, i'd be happy to pick one up. if they decide not to improve these trucks with any design improvements/updates, i'll keep my money.",2025-03-31,reddit

Ford F-150 Lightning,"‚ÄúIn a rather pleasant surprise, Ford has revealed the F-150 Lightning‚Äôs 300-mile range is already accounting for cargo. In reality, minus any cargo, a far greater range is plausible.‚Äù",2021-05-29,reddit
Ford F-150 Lightning,"‚ÄúIn its fourth month, the Cybertruck had over a thousand registrations and outsold the R1T by more than two to one,‚Äù said Tom Libby, associate director of industry analysis at S&P Global Mobility.

Huh? What kind of industry analyst is he?

Four months in, and they‚Äôre still only making about 1,000 per month? That doesn‚Äôt look like a ramp-up at all. When they did their pedal recall in April, almost 4,000 CTs were affected. So they sold 4,000 in five months, and 1,000 of those were in their fourth month, March. The numbers are flat, if not going down. 

If they really plan on making 250,000 of them per year, they‚Äôd need to make over 20,000 per month. While laying off people. 

And that target is ludicrous, because the CT is pretty much exclusively a US market vehicle. So they‚Äôre planning on outselling the Toyota Tacoma with this break-down prone monstrosity. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2024-05-17,reddit
