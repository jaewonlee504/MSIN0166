Tesla Cybertruck,"When you get hit you will not be fine. The way cars deform on impact is an energy absorption design, to avoid the energy of the impact to be totally transferred to the occupants.

I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be seeing millions of these on the road, ever.<br><br>There&#39;s not enough chumps with that kind of money to throw away.

Tesla Cybertruck,"I will say to be honest I hated the design and think it’s so stupid. But now it’s kinda growing on me and after seeing its features kinda cool <br><br>BUT my opinion still is not the “cyber truck is a real truck to do real truck things” I seen videos they do “EXTREME” things and it’s mild at best then an actual capable truck. Also build quality compared to like a Chevy and ford seems worst. To be fair this is like 1 gen issues like I remember watching a video of the front bar for the wheels broke and did the 👉👈 look so yes it’s nice for a road car but anything more I’m concern lol<br><br>Edit: alright I got to admit something else too. Most tucks are not doing truck things. They are on the road 1000% agree and if those who need a truck to do truck things I think most of the time they will be using stronger trucks like 250-350 in fords and chevys numbering scheme. Vs a normal 150 or 1500 I will say though I want it be good in off road conditions which. I think the cyber truck can manage especially for the ground clearance I just wonder on worst conditions like mud, slopes, getting out from being stuck, stuff like that.",2025-02-18T01:47:50Z,YouTube,"design, build_quality",0

Tesla Cybertruck,"Already outdated.  Already declining sales. AMC Pacer and Gremlin are icons. Plymouth Duster. I suppose Cybertruck qualifies. Edit: I just thought of the case for you: Lamborghini Countach .  If you ever see one up close, sit n one, or drive one you realize what a terrible design and useless POS it is compared to other supercars. But it serves the same purpose as the Cybertruck: Adolescent boys and over the hill rich men both think it makes them special Well, OK, :&quot;special&quot;. To be fair, Cycbetruck probably works better in some respects, but it is already dated, and in decline because it is an over-priced boat anchor of a working truck and just wretched excess.

You can afford all of the illegal south americans you can find but trucks on the other hand are precious and you can only afford like one of those.  Plus the illegal family needs somewhere to live.  That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t need to fit in the garage.  It is the garage and the bedroom, and dining room.",2025-03-28T21:38:33Z,YouTube,none,0

European roads are not wide enough for it plus the monstrosity does not comply with European/UK regulations or Health and Safety.

But, let&#39;s not forget about the cost of insurance being double (some places, like CA, triple), tires wear significantly faster, road trips require EA-type charging which is spendy (and can be very stressful and inconvenient) cost to purchase is high, and cost to install a charger at home. The catch-up can take a few years to break even, at which point battery degradation and resale are impacted. If you don&#39;t mind those things, it&#39;s moot.

You need to go to a specific Technician that is trained in electrical vehicles so you know that your truck is going to come out of the shop in one piece. Another thing is yes you’re saving a bunch of money in gas. However, these electrical vehicles that are pushed on us are very expensive upfront as well. What they should do is make an electrical vehicle that is The cost of an regular sedan so that people can try it out and once they see how useful it is, and how affordable it is, and how much money they’re saving then once the car crap out they can go and possibly buy a more expensive model of an electrical vehicle.

I’ve been driving Tesla’s for 10 years now.  Once the F-150 Lightning comes with the NACS charger built-in, I’ll be buying one.  Also, it would be nice to know what the rear, lockable, tonneau (?) cover costs?  One other thing: when is there going to be a convertible EV?  Ford should make either a Mustang or Thunderbird convertible EV.  That’s one thing I miss, having had a 2-door Mercedes hard-top convertible awhile back.

There&#39;s no way to do heavy computing tasks (editing photo/video, gaming, coding, etc) on an iPad, as much as Apple wants you to believe otherwise. <br><br>EVs are in a similar position now. Everyone is predicting that soon they will be everywhere and there will be no place for ICE vehicles anymore. But I think that actual working vehicles that really do need to haul thousands of pounds will be ICE for a long time. Even as 90% of all cars on the road become EVs there will still be a need for towing a very long distance, and that&#39;s where ICE cars will shine. The Lightning is the equivalent of the iPad Pro.

Ford F-150 Lightning,"8 degrees hahahahahha.  Canadians and the upper Midwest, “Hold my beer.”<br><br>There is a reason I leased the 2024 extended range lightning Flash.  I will buy a used one when they have 500+ mile range. When it is -10F+ mine will loose 40-45% of its range. It sucks, and is why I got the extended range with a heat pump. It won’t be a big deal when they have a bigger range.  <br><br>Love my Lightning overall, it’s so sweet.  Once we finally get our level 2 charger it will be no big deal really overall. I have come to the conclusion that a guy needs to have one gas vehicle right now if you live in really cold areas.<br><br>To me, your “issues” are kind of whinny sounding, sorry. Haha. I mean you just seem like someone who notices every little noise, etc. It probably didn’t help that you bought the first year model either.<br><br>I agree, you definitely want a level 2 charger and a garage. It will take at least 2-4days to charge  it on a trickle charger, depending on how far you took it down and how big the battery is.  I would assume you need a level 2 charger for every EV if you are going to drive them any real distance and/or you live in real cold areas.<br><br>You sound like a nice guy, but you also probably just need content. Who else would sell a vehicle for that kind of hit after only 20k miles and less than 2 years use?  If I was you I would just do a two year lease in every vehicle you get.

Like it or not, these trucks on new purchase and sale are federally subsidized $11,500. Also with Ford losing money on them doesn&#39;t mean the resale value should be low, it just means the manufacturing and R&amp;D costs far outweigh sales. As they continue to strip back options, increase the price as they have with the 2025 model, these trade-in values should stay decent. Especially so if they never LFP batteries last longer. You also see that as part of the residual value on a lease, the bank is thinking the same thing.

A lot of the issues have been corrected with OTA updates. For me, I’ve had a wonderful experience with the Lightning. It’s a great truck for my needs. It will not replace all ICE trucks.

It is leagues a head of the other BEVs below $100,000 for being a large comfortable four adult vehicle with good driving characteristics and incredible ride well into the 80 mph area.  That&#39;s compared to non sports BEVs.  Tesla appears to be the only BEV that has software development and continues maintenance correct.  As lacking as the Ford dealership service experience has been, being a Ford does mean there is a huge network of Ford dealers across North America that Tesla lacks.    I&#39;m a sports sedan guy, but the Lighting once its software bugs are reasonably smoothed out and major upgrade in battery ability I&#39;d seriously consider when needing a large comfortable fast vehicle for four adults.  All BEV really only make reasonable sense with over night home charging.   The goal is 5 minute fast charging.   That is still slower than filling a gasoline car, but it is close enough to be thought comparable.

The highway king is great, the only thing I did to it was chrome the upper and lower front forks. It looks amazing and everyone loves it. I really dig the old school look but I’m trying to get used to that high seat, I was going to buy an ultra limited, but I was a little concerned about the weight in terms of being top-heavy and I wasn’t sure if I would really do the kind of riding that it was built for….. my previous bike was a 2002 Road king classic in Black which I really loved.  I like the old school with the white wall tires and the spoked wheels which is what attracted me to the highway king. Too many bikes today are simply black or gray years ago. There was a lot more color on motorcycles. I’d like to see Harley come out with more color options and bring back more chrome.

Rivian R1T,"It&#39;s hard to take Rivian seriously when we have no idea if they will go bankrupt in the next year or two. Consumers are paying through the nose for this status symbol and being asked to also take on the risk that Rivian goes bust. As for the truck, it&#39;s a small, mid size truck with limited truck utility. If you are someone who wants an EV truck, there are far better options. Who cares about a truck pull, really a dumb idea from Edmunds to even do it, as if that makes a difference when buying a truck. Take your Rivian to Home Depot and try to do actual work with it, like loading sheets of plywood and then put it next to the GM EV truck offering. No competition. Load a bunch of 29er mountain bikes in the bed, and see what kind of room you have, I know the answer, none. We head to the trails and see people trying to shoe horn their mountain bikes in the bed and it is like a clown car. Even the new Tacoma long bed is far superior in terms of utility, let alone a real full size truck for mountain bike adventures. When the Rivian failed and would not start, how long did it take before it was towed? How long before you got a loaner? How long before the repair was done and how much was the repair cost? Even if the warranty covered it, it would be interesting to know the real world cost of the repair, give us real data where you have it.",2023-10-12T13:34:28Z,YouTube,price,6

Rivian R1T,"I feel sorry for electric  car  drivers and future  owners. They will simply  have to learn the hard way .. as I did. These things are a huge hassle and a outrageous expense  in the long run. Batteries  are very ... very expensive to replace ( thousands of dollars) ...  and make no mistake, you will be replacing them. These batteries are highly toxic to our environment,  with a high potential for disaster to our surroundings. Plus I regret all the  lost hours at these charging  stations.  I wish I knew all this before I bought my car .  Do your homework before buying !",2022-07-18T22:55:03Z,YouTube,"price, battery",5

I&#39;m not in a hurry to buy a truck in an imminent sense....so I&#39;m curious as to when Tesla get around to remedying some of the obvious &quot;flaws&quot; or bugs whether its the comically small &amp; cheap rear-view mirror ( best answer is replace with a dedicated camera - mirror system )...or the lack of driver stalk controls, or the tiny headlights .....things like that.....meanwhile Rivian is like Tesla&#39;s younger brother....bold, brash, has many if the same people, and seems determined to build high-quality stuff......I like the range possible  of the Rivian R1T....and lots of other aspects of it........your videos reassure me it would be a good buy even at similar dollars.....",2025-02-13T22:13:00Z,YouTube,"range, build_quality",0

Rivian R1T,"Hello there, 1st/ I like your Rivian, which I honestly believe it is a superior EV vs many others out there. Although, I use to own a “22 Mustang MachE GT recently, Dual Motor &amp; Extended Battery too, as well as rated 270 miles range. All I can say is that I still like the Rivian brand for whatever reason.. Anyway, Rivian in the past used to have 4 motors, or one for each wheel IF I am not wrong but not sure, and then the batteries a little better than my MachE GT in my opinion. Moreover, I don’t want to be the individual that sound very “against such EV technology” which I personally believe that it is a nice way of transportation, BUT in the same time it has its one benefits as well as it has also MANY downsides too, regrettably, and take it from a guy that used to own one EV too.. I paid over $77.4k for mine in Dec 2022, and close to a year later I was crying for my money spent in that vehicle. Not to mention the unbelievable DEPRECIATION of my EV like many others out there, that got down to less than half of what I paid for, pretty much close to a year later, since there were so many available on the market and NOT many people were interested to buy them. Luckily I was able to traded in mine and got rid of it, but losing more than half or $38k back only. Therefore a ding of $39.4k lost, when in fact I should have got close to what I paid for considering that I did not have many miles on board and the car was looking immaculate. 2nd/ Here is what I try to explain to many people out there and IF this sound great “tip” or something that might resonate with many of you while considering such EVs, as well as what it trully means to own one, and the issues that some of you will find later on then great, otherwise, do what each and everyone of you would like. 3rd/ I am strongly encouraging everyone out there that is looking for one EV to listen my point of view and my side of the story, before considering committing and buying one. 4th/ The cost of operating one EV it might sound cheaper and more convenient, BUT in reality it is NOT, regrettably. For example: the distance that “you” think that you can travel and that is listed on your dash, IT IS NOT a real distance that you might travel in reality while monitoring the true miles traveled. Meaning, lets just say that in a full battery state the dash might tell you that you will be able to travel about 270 miles, BUT in reality you and your vehicle will travel ONLY 190 miles max, and that is only IF you are not using your A/C or heating, have to go up hills or stuck in traffic. Now, “you” will start panicking when “you” see that you get close to half of “battery” charge state left juice and then “you” immediately NEED to find another charging station so that “you” will NOT get stuck in some whatever place in this country, and NOT be able to reach your destination or even worse, go and deplete your battery totally, and then requires towing bottom line, let alone that is NOT good for the battery if “your” battery/car gets there. The manufacturer stated pretty clear, try to avoid driving your EV car while having less than 30% of the battery and avoid at all cost going to “Zero”.. Also, repeated “Fast Charging” it is NOT recommended either, since the batteries will start depleting much faster than normal, “meaning wear and tear”. Besides that, it is quiet significant the price that EV owners need to pay almost every 90-100 traveled miles, so that “you” do not get to risk finding another charging station. I have seen numerous time this issue, while I owned my EV, which was driving to a place and then NONE of the charging stations available were working, which force me to drive all over the places and find one working.. Not sure how many times I was “sweating” so bad and got so amped up as well as super anxiety going through my body, thinking that this new charging place might have the same issues.. So, it can be pretty scary.. 5th/ The cost of charging it can get pretty nasty, as many of already encountered yourself, or $0.45/kwh or even higher which is crazy, considering that I live in CA, and I thought that here it is super pricy, but $0.67/Kwh as some people claimed they encountered in some places then that it is insane.. So, traveling about 100 miles and then charge again, NOT only it is horrible and super annoying, but also a wasteful day and time, doing that daily and few times in between, while you travel, so that you can go a decent distance being in your Vacay or somewhere else as daily needed, besides shorter distances too.. 6th/ The center gravity of the vehicle it is very low, not to mention that the tires wear out much faster than the ICE regular cars, while these batteries are very heavy too, and that put a lot of pressure on your “rubbers and breaks”, not to mention that anything that you can and will hit with your undercarriage since the batteries are so low to the ground surface, and can easily be destroyed while running over something more dangerous or debris.. 7th/ So, the MOST discouraging it is the fact that in 6-7 years MAX depending on how much you use your EV, then “you” will be face with an enormous bill, such as replacing the entire battery pack, since these that your car have already, are getting less mileage and not hold the “juice” as much anymore as when the batteries were new. The cost of such batteries replacement it is according with as many brands out there, or more than $20k+, in many cases, which is astonishing in my opinion, meaning I rather pay for gasoline gradually and change the engine oil as well as filters regularly, vs coming with a $20k+ for new batteries. Let alone that when replacing the entire battery pack then most likely “you” need to change the glycol fluid I would assume most likely, since that is what cool the batteries, and it will be drain instead of reuse I would assume. Also, I am pretty much sure that some “High Voltage Cables” might need to be replaced too, since these are the ones that could be considered a fire hazard due to so much usage, and burning (wear and tear) of these cables, or perhaps the rubber sealing used gets bed and therefore might need to be replaced in order to make prevent the rain/water of getting in.. I guarantee you that the technicians will find some craaap to inflate your repair bills for sure.. 8th/ The replacement of the batteries pack it is a VERY complicated thing to do, just google it, and NOT many shops could do that I would assume, since there is a process to be followed and specialized personnel that is qualified to work with such High Voltage power/battery, de-energizing, etc, let alone that these shops need a specific jacks for such heavy replacements/repairs.. And for you folks that think that the Warranty of “your” EV battery it is not an issue, and that the warranty covers these defective batteries, then all I can tell you is that the manufacturer will replace ONLY the cells/modules that are considered useless, and then install only few vs the whole battery pack, not to mention that they will replace only these defective modules or cells, with A refurbished batteries, just to get you in your way and be done with your warranty for the time being.. Meaning few weeks later or perhaps few month later, “you” will be back in the shop looking for another swap of batteries, repeating the same process until “your car” is out of that total warranty, in my opinion and allegedly since we kinda know how the dealership kinda works in general.. I heard some people saying that the cost of replacing your battery pack can go as high as $27K+ too, depending on which type of battery your car might need. 9th/ The whole US infrastructure of such EV charging stations it is NOT even covering as much as it is necessary considering the increase of EV owners, and if that continue to grow in ownership then the lack and the capacity could be overwhelming, therefore it could get ugly and the waiting lines at the charging stations be an issue for miles, which will get people in fist fights in order to charge their EVs, claiming all kinds of “emergencies”, due to impatience and arrogance while tired of waiting I would assume.. 10th/ Charging at home can get expensive too, considering the hikes of energy prices or cost overall as far as I have seen, let alone the inconvenience of watching such process while you have your car parked outside and not into any garage too. There were unbelievable disgusting instances in which other individuals parked next to your car and charge theirs vehicles instead.. 11th/ Having an “EV”, then “you” can NOT travel remotely or off grid much, since there could be NO charging stations anywhere you might go or want to go.. So, in the end, the money that people might think that they save IF that is even a possibility, then each and everyone of “you” will have to come with a big chunk of money when you change your battery pack few year down the road, depending as I said it d how much you truly use your EV daily, besides IF you don’t have ANY other problems with anything else, which the EVs have their own issues too, as we all can see, let alone the high cost of repairs and insurance, once again, too. I personally got back to a gas car, in the end, since I got tired of all of things as stated above.. I will ONLY recommend such EV technology for retired individuals, which these don’t go to work each and every day, and don’t have to charge daily their vehicles, as well as for people that have their own garage and keep the EV vehicles out of the elements, due to a certain recommended temperature in which the battery can prolong their lifespan..

Chevy Silverado EV,"More depreciation! You have to own a Ev for over 4 or 5 years. To justify its impact over ice powered vehicles. Most people trade their vehicles in before then. So your Ev Vehicle drops by 2-3 times in value more than a comparable ice vehicles. How much is a 10 year old truck 1/2 ton worth? $20,000. A 10 year old Rivian will only be worth 10-15%. Who wants to stop 3-4 more times to charge (20min-1hr++) on a road trip? Yes my family road trips . 14760 in USA. We have factories and colleges in our town. Great jobs low cost of living. Small town so u travel over 100 miles to get to family friendly fun. Electric vehicles are 10-15 away from being practical. The government can’t afford to give incentives or to grow the infrastructure. Try ice vehicles till about 2035 or 2040. How is 8000 lbs going to handle a 5000lbs vehicle in a crash? Great?

The ICE (Duramx) based pick up that I replaced this year was getting expensive to operate as a daily driver and a tow vehicle.  I will disagree with the assessment that this pick up truck is not well suited for the road trip demands because it is an EV.  That is actually not the case, the built in NAV is very capable of direct route planning for road trips with and without the trailing involvement.

Third, ok, so you have a trailer attached, how are you going to charge your truck, at a charging station, most places only have 2 or 4 stations. If someone is there charging their car, you have to unhook your trailer and then charge your truck. Fourth, and this is the big one, nobody has thought of, if we pay a gas tax, to go for the repairs of the highway, wouldn&#39;t there be a tax on electricity once this really becomes popular.? So, how much will this be.? And this last one I love the best.!

It’s too expensive, it takes far too long for a fill-up, its towing capacity is a small fraction that of a conventionally fueled truck and the electric charging and electric distribution infrastructures in the US are still woefully inadequate for widespread adoption of electric vehicles.  <br><br>Note that we can now easily refill a 400-450 mile range vehicle from empty in less than 10 minutes.  Even so, it’s not uncommon for there to be a line of 2-3 cars during peak demand periods.  Imaging now what the lines will be like when a recharge a 250-300 mile range vehicle that takes 45-60 minutes to recharge from empty.  <br><br>Neither technology nor infrastructure are ready to support electric vehicles at even 10% market penetration. It would be far more sensible to ease into an EV world using PHEV, plug-in electric, vehicles with an all electric range of 100 miles, supplemented by a gasoline or diesel engine.",2023-09-13T17:47:57Z,YouTube,"range, performance, price, battery",0

Test a 1500 series V8 ICE truck to an EV Truck in a towing test and see who can get the furthest on a single tank/charge while pulling the exact same trailer and load.  HINT: It wont be the EV.  Those of us that actually use our trucks for towing will never use an EV for that until the technology makes it so that the charge doesn&#39;t go down by 75% when towing a 5000lb trailer/load.<br><br>Plus the price for the EV Silverado, that makes the demand for ICE trucks go up even more.

Chevy Silverado EV,"New combustion tech will have 75% efficiency vs EV at 85% and will have 6000/8400 mile HWY range with a 88 gallon tank on Ethanol/gasoline, 10,000/14,000 city.  68 mpg Hwy/116 MPG city, 97 MPG combined.<br><br>CO2 capture (dry ice) allows air conditioning while engine is off.  The engine is a combusiton heat pump of sorts.  The combustion engine torques out from ZERO RPM with no battery or EV nonsense need.  It has 100% brake recovery vs EV at 50%.  In city, it will be ~2x better MPGe than EV with no thermal needs/control, and 3-4 times better in extreme hot/cold.  Weight is 4200 LBs ( 200 LB less than 2000 Silverado) or 1/2 the EV Silverado.   Can tow up to 26,000 GVW limit with added tow tech with range of 1500 to 2000 mile range for a camper.  AWD, front and rear steering for ease of towing, turning around and parking.  Has Electric genset for 5 kw with engine driving genset and inverter with 1/2 kw capacity to buffer power.  Can use 5 kw genset to move car in no combustion mode if need for indoor use.  <br><br>Make fuel at home for $1/gal with CO2 capture (1/2 above range) on vehicle.

Chevy Silverado EV,"You cannot compare a 1/2 ton vehicle to 3/4 on ride. The F250 3/4 hauls more then twice the weight in the bed and tows over twice as much as that EV, so yes the F250 does not ride like a unibody SUV with a pickup bed.  If your going to compare ride you should have compared it to the Lightning which rides much better than a 3/4 ton truck. I would be interested in how efficient it is  both Dodge and Chevy went with huge batteries that are almost twice as large as the Lightning&#39;s . Those big batteries make both the Chevy and Dodge EV&#39;s weight over a thousand pounds more then the Lightning too.  I know range is a big thing but that battery size and cost to replace is going to be nuts. I think the Silverado EV is more of a SUV with a trunk that has less pickup bed payload than a Ford Ranger and almost a 1,000 pound less than the Lightning.  Unibody will not work well as a Frame like real trucks have they tired it a long time ago and it did not work well. That RST model is just one ugly SUV with a pickup bed.

Chevy Silverado EV,"The problem with EV’s at the moment is tech depreciates so fast. Like having an Apple Watch and next year they come out with Apple 2.0. The upgrade isn’t significant but it’s the latest greatest tech and the old drops 50% in Value. Not to mention the charging and fear of running out of juice when taking trips. How much range does it have while towing? I leased a EV and it advertised 283 miles for the range. I actually got 193 miles per charge. I work in the car industry and trade every year for a new vehicle. I gave EVs a chance and man the tech is amazing, but honestly I would never purchase another one. These vehicles need an emergency engine maybe a 2 cylinder with reserved fuel with a 50 mile range just in case. The Hummer was hot for a second and now we can’t give them away. Mercedes is having the same issue. They made going green a poor issues while only the top 1% can afford the EVs in the first place. Going green has become commercialized to the point that the advantage person can’t do it. Lol its insane",2024-07-05T00:18:09Z,YouTube,"range, performance, battery, tech",0

Chevy Silverado EV,These electric vehicles are retarded. They are not green vehicles as most people that buy them don’t charge from green energy. It’s dumb to burn fuel to charge a battery when you can burn fuel to run the vehicle. This is just fuel burning with extra steps and a higher price tag. I laugh at people who drive electric vehicles. You can buy two new trucks for that price and you would do more for the environment not being wasteful.,2024-06-18T18:56:18Z,YouTube,"price, battery",0

I also suggested, in the strongest of terms, that they get rid of the front seat Console. These freaking dinosaurs should go the way of the dodo bird. They’re ridiculous. Get them gone - yesterday! I want to move around the truck freely. Dammit. 😅 And my final ask to them was to have a cruise control at any speed as long as it was under the speed limit.

Why have a 6.2 liter super fast engine and a 140 speedometer with it not allowed to go fast? I’ve been told it’s because the driveline isn’t strong enough to handle the high speed torque with that much weight.,2023-12-16T14:06:36Z,YouTube,performance,0

If you really looking for a workhorse this is not the vehicle. The original Hummer still had a range of 400 plus miles and you don&#39;t have to wait for charge. And I can&#39;t imagine with this kind of speed and 9,000 lb combined with the poor driving skills of some yuppie who just had the money to be able to spend on this thing. This is a really bad combo.

GMC Hummer EV,H3 wasnt got the road is was a jeep sized offroad vehicle with better mpg and different capabilities easier for the average person. It had a v8 also in some inline 5 was fine for offroading v8 better tho and sounds better. A little lift and whatever jeeps do aka tires a must and lift and suspension tops. Hummer all u need is tires really and 4or pretty sure they all stock 4x4.  But legit you can buy the truck and go almost anywhere maybe change the tires or get it from the factory with offroad tires......  most people dont offroad they say get jr own tires if u want. Then if you get a little lift you&#39;re more than good which is what allot of jeeps. Tires will give ground clearance then lift. Usually you dont need more tha  tires. And lift will help with tires depending how big they are.,2023-02-21T21:43:25Z,YouTube,comfort,0

It has a WTF Mode for &quot;Watts to &quot;Freedom &quot;&quot; or whatever that means? Obnoxiously American, check.

GMC Hummer EV,"Too bad these are going for over $200,000 USD after dealer markups and scalpers reselling theirs. At least some Ford dealerships are combating scalpers by making them sign an agreement to not sell their vehicle for up to 1 year after purchase while Ford is threatening to hold inventory from dealerships that abuse the price with insane markups, hopefully GM will try to reign in their dealerships so they can actually sell for MSRP.",2022-07-05T07:08:09Z,YouTube,price,0

GMC Hummer EV,This things an everyone killer. It&#39;s super cool but I&#39;m expecting someone to get manslaughter charges first year.
