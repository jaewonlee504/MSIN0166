Post,Tesla Cybertruck,Does anyone like the cybertruck?,94,646.0,2024-10-14,0.0,0.385,0.3612
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I appreciate the willingness to take risks when every vehicle today is either an F-150, Suburban, or Rav4. We need some new design concepts out there.

That said, the triangle profile makes it unusable as a truck (same problem as the old Honda Ridgelines and Avalanches), and simultaneously less useful than a large SUV. If Tesla had released a truck/van platform focused on utility instead of design they would have killed Rivian and could make huge strides in fleet vehicles.",305,,2024-10-14,0.099,0.131,0.2516

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I had a 2 door standard cab 2000 Ranger (gas). I'd take an electric version above the CT and day of the week. Why? It had a 6' bed that could actually hold long lumber. As long as the Ranger EV could tow, I'd be fine.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"To answer your question, yup. Been in one a handful of times and it’s a really fun car to drive too. The only thing I’m holding out on is more range option for better hauling. 

It amazes me how polarizing this vehicle is that people who don’t like it spend so much time talking about how they don’t like it. It reminds me of the early days of Apple vs Android and the insane lengths people who don’t plan on purchasing something care about other peoples buying decisions.",122,,2024-10-14,0.027,0.176,0.9348
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"There’s something about it that looks ok. I own a Jeep Gladiator so I clearly already have brain damage, but it’s too simplified. I have a bed cap so it’s basically just longer SUV with camping drawers that come out for hauling things way more than I thought I would. All to say, I’d take a free one. 🤣",6,,2024-10-14,0.029,0.149,0.8638
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I don't mind the goofy appearance.  It's a truck, not a work of art.

But that said....it stinks because it didn't hit the target price, it didn't hit the target range (or even come close), and it has had 5 recalls already.  Two of the recalls I will ignore because they can be fixed with software but the wiper motor failure, the accelerator that could get stuck, and the parts flying off the vehicle are embarrassing and dangerous.

So it seems like a flop right now.  The Ford F-150 Lightning and Chevy Silverado EV seem much more practical.

I was rooting for the Cybertruck to be an affordable cool EV truck...as initially promised.   But the delivered product is not affordable and the specs are meh.",22,,2024-10-14,0.167,0.066,-0.9319

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I love mine, however I wouldn’t want one if I lived in a city. The visibility blocked by the a-pillars is not great and despite the nimble steering, the thing is pretty big. 

For me it’s been a really smooth ride, easy to drive, accelerates like crazy, and fun as hell off road. Steer by wire is probably the most underrated/under-appreciated thing, combined with the rear wheel steering, driving a car with traditional steering feels weird now. The nimbleness of the steering and the cameras/software has made transitioning from my much smaller Jeep Cherokee surprisingly easy. People give it crap for being unnecessarily big, but it’s actually the lightest EV pickup sold in the US (that I know of) and has a big bed, and a ton of interior space. I have an electric skateboard and Efoil so the large bed + locking tonneau cover are also huge pluses.",42,,2024-10-14,0.069,0.112,0.7171
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I was on the waitlist.  I was down with the outside-the-box approach when they were touting 500 miles and Musk was throwing steel balls at it.  Teslas at the time were a tech nerd car with generally undeniable performance.  I expected real life to polish off some of the zanier design elements.

It arrived and it looks pretty much exactly like its concept, which I actually don't hate.  But it didn't deliver the 500 miles, and it certainly didn't deliver its proposed price range.

Throw in Musk's erratic and unpredictable management, his full embrace of wannabe 4chan memelord persona, the neverending FSD edging, and insurers getting flaky about covering it, and it's just too much weirdness in one package.

GMC (shockingly) is delivering one of the best overall propositions to me in their new Sierra EV, and just added the 2025 to their website.  So far as I can tell, it's all of the great things I liked in Cybertruck with none of the drawbacks.

Edit:  I *am* intrigued about some of the fundamental design elements that are novel(ish) on the CyberTruck, like the 48V architecture, and whether that's a genuine breakthrough or gimmick.",11,,2024-10-14,0.034,0.139,0.9775

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I am not a fan of Tesla, and don't plan to ever own one. That being said, I really like the look of the Cybertruck...it has a Mad Max feeling to it--though I think it would be cooler if they would have gone more compact. They seem like murder vehicles, both for drivers and pedestrians, but it's nice seeing them on the road (I'm in the Puget Sound area, so I see them not infrequently).",3,,2024-10-14,0.077,0.104,0.2882

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Non-owner but a guy who actually uses his truck.
I also have an EV and own Tesla stock, so this is painful to say:

A friend of mine purchased a cyber truck and yeeeeeah, I lied about liking it. It just reminds me of something that Homer Simpson would design. The functionality of using it as a truck, bed hauling, loading,  climbing in, is impractical. The interior is very underwhelming considering the price. The light show was pretty cool I guess.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I don't have it but think it's pretty cool. I don't understand how people are so against it. Tesla fixed so many common complaints truck people have about trucks but people just can't get past the looks.

It's so weird, you'd think these tough, function over form, best tool for the job at all costs guys would be all over it. But they complain about the looks like a teenage girl complains about an outfit or hand bag.

Some examples:
No secure trunk space, unless you pay for a hard top that can only open 30°, Tesla included a rolling durable shutter cover

Complaints of rusting out frame/body. All stainless steel or aluminum, will never rust

Poor visibility, added cameras everywhere 

Bogs down when towing, has unmatched torque

Poor turning radius, 4 wheel steering

Poor fuel economy, electric and very aero

It's a bullet proof truck, literally even, and yet people can't get past the looks, you'd think they were shopping for a dress.",11,,2024-10-14,0.167,0.127,-0.6286

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Old thread ik but I wanted to pop my 2 cents after driving one. The driving experience is actually sublime. it has steer-by-wire so theres no physical connection to the wheels (Think the technology that big commercial jets and fighter planes have) this means I can make a U-turn in this truck or parallel park this w my pinky moving it from right to left. I almost forgot how.....interesting looking of a vehicle I was driving cuz again it genuinley makes every other car including other Teslas immediatly feel so so old. After driving it I would actually consider getting one for the driving experience. I know its not a real truck nor am I gonna try to be liek ""oh yeah I drive a truck"" No, I drive a EV cosplaying as a truck but thats fine. Weirdly after driving it my brain is finding more reasons to like ti / tryna justify the looks like ""well i mean it does look kinda futuristic its not thaaat bad right""",2,,2024-12-24,0.032,0.108,0.9217

People see me. Cars yield to me. I can see over bushes and other cars so it’s easier to make turns without worrying about other cars blocking my view.

If you want a truck. Get a diesel F-250 and do truck things. EVs can’t really tow 2,000 miles at a decent pace. ",2,,2025-01-13,0.026,0.167,0.9004

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I am a Tesla Y owner. I think the Tesla Cybertruck has some interesting new technology like steer by wire, 48V, ethernet communication. On the other hand, I just cannot warm to the look. I think it is really ugly. My opinion. I think the Ford Lightning is so much nicer to look at than the Cybertruck. I would buy a Lightning if I wanted a truck. I also think the Mach e is nicer looking than the Y. I bought the Y mainly for the supercharging network. My wife is not a car person at all. She simply does not notice them. When she saw a cybertruck on the road , she asked me. ""What is that thing? It is sooo ugly!"" She could not believe it was the same brand we drive. Why Tesla did not build a more conventional looking pickup truck in line with their branding is beyond me. They would have had a killer product.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Aesthetically, no. I think they are ugly as sin, and I believe this is probably due to Musk's handling of the design and his vision.

Functionally, no. They have a sheer-prone frame, panels that rust, and the whole thing can be bricked by a car-wash. Not to mention that the bed is tiny relative to the size of the vehicle, and like most modern trucks, the ever-growing vehicle size is dangerous to literally everyone else out on the road.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I'm in the North Bay. Had Fords growing up. I ordered back in 2019 and didn't hesitate to order the foundation series. I know the design is weird AF but I was incredibly fed up with Ford and their shady business practices. At the time, my wife had a model X. It rarely needed service and Tesla was able to fix some issues remotely. Meanwhile, my Ford needed a $5000 transmission rebuild in less than 100K miles and needed a $9000+ engine rebuild shortly after that. Tesla doesn't want their cars in for service and doesn't rely on a service model. So when the Cybertruck was announced, I knew I was in.

I love the truck and use it for truck things. I can't see having a use for it in a dense city setting. The only negative I have is the towing range. But... When I compare it with my old 2006 Ford (which got 8mpg towing), the Cybertruck loses the exact same amount of range. 

So in summary, it's an awesome vehicle. When you look past the design, the engineering is mind blowing.",5,,2024-10-14,0.053,0.07,0.673

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Yeah I got the Cyberbeast a few weeks ago and it’s mind-blowingly amazing.  It’s hard to describe the feeling of driving it with the squircle plus steer-by-wire combined with the rear wheel steering and insane body rigidity it’s just orgasmic driving feel for an automobile so large.  Then we have the acceleration…. Holy shit.  It’s jaw droppingly quick, and from launch mode at a stop the anticipation of the kick from the launch is nothing short of a theme park thrill ride. My kids absolutely love it of course, kids are all attracted to it, I’m probably still 5 years old at heart.  Theeennn we the rock solid Tesla software and interface with the robust charging network and app integration.  We just got Full Self Driving (supervised) and Auto Park, those are really good but need work.  FSD particularly struggles with turns probably due to the unique steering profile of the truck.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I was a Day One reservation holder. I’ve had the option to order one since about the second week that the Foundation Series was made available (so several months now). I balked at buying it because of the much lower range than promised and the missing sixth seat.

I find it such an intriguing vehicle and I love seeing them around. The 48v architecture, 4-wheel steering, Steer by wire, and Ethernet wiring are all things that I like for the future of cars in general. The technology behind the vehicle is amazing to me and that makes it more attractive. But I came to the conclusion that with the lower range and same number of seats as my Model Y it was basically a huge version of my Model Y functionally but with a truck bed. That wasn’t worth $100k for me. I’m not sure it’s worth $80k to me either. Even if it just had the 500 mile range that was promised I would pull the trigger.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I don't hate it. It has some awkward angles for sure but overall I don't find it repulsive like so many seem to. 

I think its main problems are the usual Tesla production quality issues (sharp unfinished edges, poor panel alignment/attachment) and poor value for the price. 

If the thing were built a little bit better and actually available for $40-$50k with reasonable specs it would probably be less controversial.

A lot of the negative talking points (dangerous to pedestrians, warranty doesn't cover car wash damage) apply to plenty of other vehicles as well. The US doesn't have formalized pedestrian safety testing or standards and most full-size trucks and SUVs would likely perform poorly in such tests.

I think another issue that will come up long-term is the sameness of having all the produced trucks be the exact same color and finish. At $80-$100k at least some of the purchase price has to be going to having something cool, unique, 'bad-ass', or however the purchaser happens to feel to justify it. A lot of that is going to go away when every parking lot in their area has a few of them and they all look exactly the same.",1,,2024-10-14,0.121,0.097,-0.8262

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Recently got to test drive one.

From the jump, I thought that the vehicle looked comical, not serious, a joke, a one off just because they can. Then they actually produced it, and it literally broke my mind as an engineer and car enthusiast. Why go through all of this to prove a point? 

And I think that's the appeal, it exists, when critical thinking says it shouldn't. It's like a big F you to standards, and ""sticking it to the man"" in a way.

These were my take aways:

- The steer by wire combined with the rear wheel steering indeed helped maneuver the long wheel base of the truck. 
- Why does it even have a rearview mirror? 
- The blindspots are ridiculous. 
- I was being constantly blinded by the sun reflecting on the steel while waiting on line. 
- I forgot that big ass wiper even existed. 
- The front of the car felt like it was 20ft away from the driver's seat.
- It was quiet for a pick up with large tires
- it has a good power train
- the squircle steering hole was a little weird to use, felt like I was in an arcade driving simulator.

Overall thought: the sum of it's parts are less than the parts themselves. Meaning, it's great that there's all this new and adopted tech, but it just doesn't blow my mind from a package standpoint.

I came to the understanding that you REALLY need to like the 'design over function' character of the truck, or really fall into the hype to love it.

I drove a Gen2 Rivian R1S shortly after and as an overall package I preferred it over the Cybertruck. It just felt more purposeful and thoughtful.",1,,2024-10-14,0.037,0.081,0.9493

I don't judge anyone who likes it, but I find it fascinating how it's become a political statement and seems to attract comical owners. I've seen a few of them in real life, either parked or driving around with tinted windows so I didn't notice the driver.

I don't like the misleading stuff tesla pulled by announcing a concept car with concept specs & taking reservations while it was nowhere near ready for production. My father had one reserved for funsies but refunded his reservation years ago because Elon went so completely off the rails. 

I do like how it looks tbh, but the construction method seems like a miss and it's kinda expensive.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Being a person that drove a 4 person coupe with 2 doors and 4WD and more power than needed I can understand people buying impractical and rather useless cars for anything else than being a means of transportation in a fun way. 

The thing with the Cybertruck is that it’s sold as a practical useful car, while none of those features have been implemented properly. There are plenty of other cars that fall into the category of rather useless for practical purposes but nice to drive. 

The fun part comes when people buy them and go convince others that their impractical car is actually more useful than all others. I think the owners should just stay in their category and enjoy their impractical peace of toy. Nothing wrong with that.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I had my first up close look at the Cybertruck at the Everything Electric show at Franborough, UK just last Saturday. It's not my personal cup of tea, but then again, for me, no truck vehicle is of any kind. It's smaller than I thought, and although it is relatively big and wide, I could see it proceeding down a street in the UK. A couple of years ago at the same show, I stood next to a Ford Lightning, and that felt a lot bigger. Once again, not for me.

The thing I do admire about the Cybertruck is the audacity that Tesla used to make it. They just went for it, design wise, and I take my hat off to them for that. However, looking at single flat sheets with ground off edges just makes it look a bit DIY, even though it's a materials achievement. It looks unfinished, but that's my feel.

What could ultimately win me over, and get me to look past it being a truck is the handling, steering, ride, performance, comfort and sheer technology. but just put all that in a gorgeous Saloon or Coupe GT \[No SUV thanks\] or even, dare I mention it, an Estate \[USA - Shooting Brake\] and Tesla would need to take my money.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"the actual engineering, the elctrical system, drivetrain, the infotainment, sensors, self drive stuff... is all pretty remarkable and is why Tesla is as successful as it is.

the problem with Teslas is typically the car that is built around that stuff. shoddy build quality. interior feels cheap and is just some chairs, a screen, and then nothing. all the budget and attention goes into the engineering side, and then the actual car is an afterthought. this is true of the model 3, model y, etc. but at least those cars generally do well for their intended purpose. ive driven the model 3 and model y, and they are incredibly fun cars to drive. the model y is pretty spacious and even having the fake 3rd row can come in handy sometimes if you are shuttling some kids around. you can look past some of the build issues like rattling and whatnot because they at least function as the cars they're intended to be.

the cybertruck, realistically, is not good for doing truck things. the cabin isnt very spacious in the back seats. the stainless steel panels, while cool in concept, lead to some awful build quality and of course fingerprints and whatnot, which is why most people end up wrapping theirs.

aside from typical tesla build issues like panel alignment or rattling, the cybertrucks in particular have been plagued with defects and recalls. just a lot of red flags around all of it

as for the design, you have to admit its bold and there is absolutely nothing like it. it will draw eyeballs. im in the minority who thinks its cool (despite having other opinions about the practicality of the vehicle, its price point for what it actually offers, and how i feel about Musk, generally). many think it looks silly. its a matter of taste. but its definitely out there and thats admirable.

I think the CyberTruck is one of those cars that's not going to get appreciated until another maybe 10-15, maybe even 20 years from now for being, as I said above, bold and not among the cookie cutter mold. I genuinely cannot think of the last time a car had this much of an impact on society solely because of the way it looks. I may get some hate for this, but I feel like the CyberTruck is the modern PT Cruiser in terms of how it's being received looks-wise, but the PT Cruiser is going through something of a renaissance now that time has passed and people realized what Chrysler was doing at the time. 

I think that about does it for me on the matter, but I'm definitely a fan of the CyberTruck, have had the pleasure of seeing a few of them around, and I always tip my cap to the drivers for not being afraid of the ridicule they'll absolutely be getting because everyone doesn't realize yet how cool that truck is.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I've put avout 6,000 miles on mine. I genuinely love it but it's not perfect. I'll highly a few pros and cons.

PROS

1. The price - might seem odd but it's one of the cheapest options on the market is got my all wheel drive for 79k

2. It's just fun to drive, i had a model 3 and this thing can turn better with all wheel steering a and has the speed of a sports car. Just fun. 

3. The back seats fold up. I have dogs and they're getting up on age so having a flat stable surface is really nice. When the seats are up they have tons of room  back there for activities and theure low enough to not really be able to go crazy from seeing out the window. A weird but big pro. 

4. I've done ""truck"" stuff. From hauling dirt, rocks etc... I can't even tell it's loaded up. 

5. Lots of cargo room. I got this because I loved EVs and wanted something to go camping with and I've had a ton of fun.  It was hard choosing CT over rivian but the tesla charging network is second to none. And while other EVs can charge within tesla network it's super awkward to be taking up 2 spots because of how the ports are on other EVs and I hate the idea of being that guy when others are waiting. 



Some Cons...


1. Until recently it's been ""ew I don't like that design"" now it's some kind of political statement. I stay far out of politics but this truck has sucked me into them in a way I never expected. 

2. Stupid large ass windshield. It struggles to keep clean. I had bigger issues early on but after it broke in the whiper blade it's gotten better. 

3. Im a tall dude but I still can't reach Into the back of the cab... the angles make it impossible. Very annoying. 

4. The stainless steel is a mess to keep clean. I shut my door by touching the window. So expect to wrap it (3-7k $) extra

5. It's stupid long... barely fits in a normal garage. I somehow lucked out and it fits decently well in mine. 

6. It's the first of it's kind so getting spare tires and accessories are oddly hard. Not to mention if one blows out the towe truck driver i had no clue how to operate it. I literally had to drive it on the truck for him.


All in all I don't regret it, my issues are mostly solvable. Updates make it better every day. And I'm hoping politics smooth over. I just wanted a fun truck.",1,,2025-03-27,0.112,0.142,0.9721

I’ve grown to like the look of the CT, but I would not buy one at this time, or any BEV truck for that matter. Range with a load just does not compete for any of them except ones with stupid-sized batteries, weight and expense. The CT seemingly is not yet adequately shaken out in its development in several aspects, but my prime reluctance is my skepticism about economical repair to its stainless steel panels with inevitable shunts.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"We own a cybertruck. We have owned model X and we still own a RAM 1500.

The Cybertruck and other EV trucks have redefined what the basic features of a truck are. A truck was a thing that could seat 5, had a good size bed, could tow stuff, (and for some people do offroading, but I didn't care about that). Now we add to that... power for tools, fridge, 14-50 for the RV, and home backup... as well as driver assist (autopilot and equivalent), fast acceleration, all wheel steering (maneuverable), steer by wire, efficiency of a Prius, and tow features like automatic trailer weight and tongue weight estimation. Note that the Cybertruck doesn't have every feature listed above, but it and a few other EV trucks have almost all those features.

As far as I can tell nobody buys a Cybertruck because of steer by wire or all wheel steering. However, once you have driven it for a week, every other vehicle is just undrivable. It makes a much bigger difference than power steering, for example. When you see <insert name of famous person> buying their second cybertruck to keep at their second home because they can't stand to drive any of their other dozen cars... I think the reason is steer by wire. It takes a week to get used to it but now I hate everything else.

Now, as to the question of why the Cybertruck compared to other EV trucks/SUVs. We like the Rivians, we like their CEO. However there were issues for us... the autopilot wasn't as good, the nearest service center is an hour away, the Rivians don't get to use all the superchargers (only the ones you don't need to use anyway) so going for example from Denver to Las Vegas via Bryce Canyon etc is more limiting even with the access that Rivians have. Also the Rivians are smaller. These were big things for us in particular and might not be for you. The other EV trucks are still good, as far as I can tell Cybertruck owners aren't extreme fans who believe every other EV truck is bad.

Looks: you are welcome to like it or hate it, personally I don't care so much but it has grown on me.

The haters: in my experience most haters are people who have spent $50k modifying their subaru. The modified subaru is an ""SUV"" that is much worse on every spec (particularly sports and utility) than the Cybertruck, but I guess people who spend $50k on modifying their vehicle have very particular tastes. Compare to a random Subaru SUV on acceleration, efficiency, towing capacity, cargo space, turn radius, ground clearance and it only wins on price (and even then only if you don't spend too much on modifications). Electric trucks make me laugh when I hear the term SUV applied to a vehicle that isn't sporty or utility. I don't hate SUVs or drivers of SUVs, just the term SUV.
The haters also tend to be on the extremes of politics (both left and right). Being in Colorado we tend to get all sorts of people, but they are usually not too intolerant.

The buyers make a strange collection of people. Some bought to flip, some bought to try to make money on YouTube and have had to do all kinds of crazy things and say all kinds of crazy things to get clicks. There are MAGAs, Kennedy fans, libertarians, preppers, liberals who are owners... but the silent (and growing) majority are normal people who just want the best vehicle for their needs.

We've used our Cybertruck to tow our Jeep through Helene (the 12v died in our 4xe), to power tools and our RV, to tow stuff around town, to carry a basement's worth of insulation, to go across country, etc. We only had a short power outage with Helene in Eastern TN but we're ready. Currently back in CO we're building a 2-level ski rack into the truck (just under the tonneau) for 12 pairs of skis with boot warmer underneath connected to the 110v outlet. we have a powered cooler and are tempted to chuck in a Keurig, microwave, electric grill for the best start to ski days. Almost all of the above can be done by other EV trucks, although the steering of the Cybertruck is great for the mountain roads we hit.",0,,2024-10-14,0.067,0.092,0.9556

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Even before Elon went MAGA, I had zero interest in buying this and this comes from someone that owns a MYLR.  Simply put, it's overpriced and not capable. 

* The tow hitch is a joke. If you're afraid to use it or it'll rip off, then you don't have the feature
* $100k and the rear view mirror isn't a camera? With the cover closed, the RVM is just an ornament and I'm sure was added just to make regulators happy. There are $35k cars that have rear view cameras. 
* You'll be lucky if you get 300 miles of range. The Silverado gets nearly 500 miles. You have to pay $16k more to get the 400+ mile range extender and lose a third of your bed space
* Unibody construction - forget about taking it off road. Not that I plan on doing so, but it shouldn't be getting stuck in half an inch of snow!
* The looks - sorry, it's an ugly car! I don't feel like driving around a statement car, where everyone is gawking and taking pictures

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,">Based on how Model S and Model X sales have been tracking, we estimate that Tesla delivered between 9,000 and 12,000 Cybertrucks in Q4

Im not American but i have to ask if theres nothing that accurately tracks sale figures in the US? Here in Germany we have a state funded authority for vehicles and they have public reports of all the data you could possibly want including sale numbers from each manufacturer and even model. Well technically theyre not sale numbers but the numbers that represent cars that are officially registered on the road. So if a car is sold but the owner has yet to officially own the car, then this is not counted but largely theyre the same numbers. 

If this exists in the US, id appreciate it if somebody links me to that data. Obviously the Cybertruck isnt sold in Europe.",48,,2025-01-02,0.0,0.061,0.7964

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,I live in Spain now where pickup trucks are very rare because a Europeans don’t see the value in them.  Thanksgiving week I went home to Austin to visit family and Cybertrucks were plentiful.  Many were wrapped to hide the angular DeLorien look.  In a local HEB supermarket lot I saw one in olive drab such that it looked like a military vehicle.  On Hwy 183 I saw another in camouflage.  I’m guessing the owners are conservatives or perhaps Tesla employees.  If you’re environmentally conscious a Rivian or Ford EV truck is more useful.  IMO they are butt ugly in any color and only attractive to those making a statement.  There are only so many people that are going to shell out so much cash to drive one.,6,,2025-01-02,0.036,0.08,0.7178

The design was supposed to represent function over form, in that it was supposed to lend itself to cheap and simple manufacturing via metal origami. That was supposed to translate to a much cheaper price.

I would have been fine driving a truck that looks like this because it would have been cheaper, and I wouldn't have minded dinging up a stainless steel truck while doing ACTUAL work, that was worth like 30k.

I'm not about to let a single scratch appear on my $100k truck. It's completely impractical.

That's really *not that bad* for a truck that's 100K.  (Which is also right where the Raptor sits... And way more sales than the Ram TRX)

But, rather obviously, that's not a mass market pickup truck, and Tesla would I'm sure like to sell these as more of a mass market vehicle.  But that likely means getting the price for at least a dual motor variant to probably $60K.

The real question is what the production cost of the CT is.  Is Tesla making $50K for every sale?  Or $20K?  Or less?

I think that Tesla would sell these things (after the normal production ramp-up shitshow) quite well at a price tag that is actually competitive with other mass market trucks, but the current price tag is just too damn high.",2,,2025-01-02,0.022,0.086,0.8551

Let’s say Elon was popular. It still would not appeal to 95% of most Tesla buyers, and the venn diagram between people who like trucks, and people who like EVs, is pretty think to begin with which is why the Lightning has struggled so much.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Just going to drop this same line every time I see one of these Tesla recall posts:



Every vehicle manufacture has multiple recalls on each build... new and older. Like a combined millions of vehciles ever year across different brands. This is nothing new or substantial. It's just getting blown up by main stream media oulets.. The ones that are consistently getting called out for lying to us all the time.

 It's a recall not a factory buy back like the headlines portray by saying ""recalled thousands of Teslas"". Recalls mean you go to the dealer and they fix it for free under warranty and then you drive it back home. I'm sure any of you that have owed/own a new GM, Chrysler, Ford, Subaru,..  the list goes on but if you own a new vehicle you'll get recalls. If you own an older model year, you'll get less recalls.

When you buy a new vehicle nearly half of the price tag is to cover the new car warranty so the factory can keep up with reimbursing dealers for warranty repairs on vehicles sold as well as the anticipation of the various forms of recalls/campaigns prompted by dealer feedback, customer feedback, and NHSTA investigations.

GM had a recall for literally putting EMPTY heated seat modules in their new trucks.. like a plastic shells instead of a computer module.  They all do dumb shit all the time. 

Quality has fallen to the way side in today's automotive industry especially in domestic brands. Factorys want retuning customers not reliable builds, thats why they promote ""brand loyalty"" purchase incentives. Is what it is. This is a result of us buyers always wanting something newer and better. 

I know this for a fact because I manage a warranty claims department for the largest dealership conglomerate in my state who sells and services multiple brands. 

The resolve? Buy something built before 2010 and keep it running or buy new and trade in every 3 years or 36k miles or lease... unless your upside down on your loan for driving the piss out of it.

Ps. Most everything built after 2019 seems to be junk unless it's top tier brands.. at best.

A vehicle is the worst return investment you can make. Just try and do it smart to loose the least amount while getting what you feel is most valued to your wants, needs, and financial situation. All brands have pros and cons and no one vehicle or ""deal"" is best for everyone

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Problem with Lightning is Ford can't seem to make a profit on it which puts it at risk of getting cut completely. It may be under priced for Ford. 
I think all EV trucks are at risk of going extinct. They can't compete with ICE's for towing range, and take too long to charge and cost a lot and aren't really that efficient. Most people can't tell if you paid the EV premium or not as they usually look like any other truck. Pull through chargers are rare so unhitching a trailer to charger every 90 miles is a PITA.
From a design standpoint the only way to fix range is to throw more battery at it which takes even longer to charge, jacks the price up substantially; and reduces its efficiency as it now has to lug its own bloated weight around all day just for the occasional tow. More battery means more structural weight to hold the weight of the battery in place. 

So while a Hummer EV has a 3k lb battery pack that only takes you 300 miles, a gas F-150 can take you over 500 miles on 130 lbs of gas. It's just so hard to beat the energy density of gas.",3,,2024-10-14,0.078,0.045,-0.7606

Tesla sells more cyber trucks in the US at 100K than all the other EV trucks on the market combined. The starting price is now $80K and I’m sure it will continue to fall as they ramp up production and bring costs down.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Finishes = asks them to configure, it does not mean that everyone has said no and asked for their deposit back. 

Entire reservation list = only the subset of the list for those in the US for the regular series and other parts of North America for Foundation.

When did the standard 2024 F150 exhaust it's reservation list? Obviously nobody wants that?

Can someone remind me how many vehicles started production in 2023 or earlier and still have a reservation list? Maybe the Tesla Semi? The list of cars that ""nobody wants"" must include every car without a reservation list? If you include cars that aren't yet in production then you can add the R2S and Aptera and I'm sure a few supercars.

If the foundation series is anything to go by, Tesla is manufacturing the Cybertrucks in various configurations and releasing the invites to make sure everything that they have produced is sold. So there is probably some combination of options where they have produced sufficient to meet demand, but most who are configuring today will still need to wait a while.

Give it a little more time and you will be able to reserve one and pick it up within a week... and eventually go to Tesla and buy one same day with a low interest rate (like all the other manufacturers are doing)... but we aren't there yet.",8,,2024-10-13,0.029,0.048,0.7514

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I get it, that is the cost they told us - with inflation (or at least very close). But the issue is - things cost more, but I make the same, so I cannot afford the higher cost. Then up in Canada our dollar is also worth less - so it's more like \~$105-110k CDN for it, so that is a hell no for something I just wanted because it was cool. 

Not complicated.

Still want one, will still get one - IF/when the price is more aligned with what I can afford.

FYI - IF I needed a truck, and I was going to spend \~20-40k near what I was going to pay for a gas truck, the savings in Fuel make it worth it. EV's at high cost are a math game for me. If the math works - sign me up. I like saving money, not wasting it.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"its kinda amazing as many of the things have been built as have been. I think the delorean is a pretty reasonable comparison (stainless design, a bit weird for its time, mechanical issues, underperformed vs what was promised, came in nearly twice the price as promised) and they only made around 9k of them. So far it looks like they've made double that number of the CTs. 

I suspect the combination of the price of the thing along with Musk's politics conflicting with that of most EV buyers is a near deathblow to these things. Cause if all the demand for them at 80k has already been expended, the CT's record setting sales numbers for an EV truck wont last long. If demand does fall off a cliff, it will be interesting to see if they keep making them or not. 

It would be interesting if they'd brought it in at around 60k after the federal tax incentive (which the 80k model does not currently qualify for).",2,,2024-10-14,0.052,0.126,0.9301

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"To be fair the Cybertruck was revealed at a different time. Pre 2020 was a different world in terms of inflation. Loans were only like 1..8%.

Price creep was inevitable, on top of all the overly optimistic price points and range to begin with. 

Range was a huge let down but I think it was foolish to assume it was even possible given battery chemistry hadn't miraculously changed. 
There's only so many places you can stash more battery to make that range possible and it comes at the expense of weight and efficiency (which requires even more battery to counter act). 

The deposit was only $100 and I can just see people impulse ordering it for the sake of doing it with no commitment. That was also so long ago people have moved on to other impulses.",2,,2024-10-14,0.037,0.078,0.4449

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"The article is saying that they finished the entire reservation list for the new trim level in 9 days because a guy in Texas ordered it in July and got his invite already. Now, Tesla normally delivers to the closest customers first, and since the truck is made in Texas, I would take that to mean they've exhausted their Texas reservation list at most.

The Cybertruck might be suffering the same fate as the Hummer H2 (and to a lesser extent the H3). The public hate for it is so loud that even most of the people who want it won't order it because of what other people will think of them. A lot of people drive vehicles to project an image, and if that image isn't cool then they won't buy it. So, I have no doubt they're having trouble converting reservations, but I'm not convinced it's quite as bad as this article suggests. 

If the Truck came in at its original price, I'm sure they'd convert a lot more reservations because at that price it's not only one of the cheapest EVs on the market, it's one of the cheapest large trucks on the market. People will buy anything if it's cheap enough (ex. Vinfast).",1,,2024-10-14,0.079,0.045,-0.8239

**Here's the full login locked article:**


*""Tesla, a future case study for securities law classes across America, had to stop delivering Cybertrucks this past weekend. No, not because the hundred-thousand–dollar medium-duty pickup, which is only any of those things in the loosest interpretive sense, tends to brick when it gets rained on; nor because its stainless steel panels get all rusty and nasty-looking after weeks exposed to the rare, harsh condition of ""being outside."" Perhaps you think it has something to do with the shorter-than-advertised driving range and longer-than-advertised charging time, but no: Rather, the cause of this snag is that the trucks struggle with the basics of stopping and going, by which I mean that the accelerator pedal cover slides off and gets stuck under a panel and locks the accelerator pressed down and keeps the Cybertruck stuck at maximum velocity.*""

The company was sued in 2017 by drivers whose cars drove themselves unexpectedly through garages and into walls; a German paper reported last year on over 2,400 complaints about sudden braking problems; and a safety researcher published a white paper showing how voltage spikes could lead Teslas to speed up without warning. You are supposed to like this because it means you are on the cutting edge, helping Elon Musk in his quest to save humanity.""*


*""Suckers who ordered Cybertrucks a few months or years ago and expected deliveries this weekend did not get their cars, nor a precise explanation for why they did not get their cars, but instead were simply told, ""Hi, we have just been informed of an unexpected delay regarding the preparation of your vehicle. We need to cancel your delivery appointment for tomorrow and we will reach out again when we’re able to get you back on the schedule."" Maybe someone with a hot glue gun will get on this one.""*


*""Tesla's bad, stupid week got worse and stupider on Monday, when the company announced it would be laying off more than 10 percent of its workforce, cutting some 14,000 jobs. In typical Tesla fashion, the layoffs were ruthless and sudden, following hot on Tesla's announcement of its first quarterly sales decline (a drop of 8.5 percent) since the pandemic. Drew Baglino, an executive who'd been around since 2006, and Rohan Patel, a former Obama administration guy hired to help Tesla do corruption and skirt regulation, also announced they would be leaving the company of their own accord. I am tempted here to wonder whether this means Tesla is beginning a meaningful decline—indeed, the stock is down—but the company, which is a stock racket that happens to sell cars, has operated at a level beyond rational analysis for years.*""

*""It's unclear how many Cybertrucks are on the road, and Tesla won't say (masterful gambit, sir), though the number likely falls between 1,000 and 5,000. People who have them now had to sign up years ago, and those who sign up now won't get their cars for another five years or so. Anyone who bought one reportedly had to sign an agreement barring them from selling their Cybertruck within 12 months, or else they would have to pay a $50,000 fine and give Tesla the option to buy it back.""*

*""As the Bay Area is both a nexus for world-class goobers and the region where Tesla used to be and kinda-sorta still is headquartered, I have seen a lot of Cybertrucks out in the wild over the past few months. They are remarkably fake- and shitty-looking in any context (Is that a big toaster with wi-fi next to me at the exit? Who's driving the scrap metal assemblage with Bryan Colangelo-esque proportions? Why does every Cybertruck driver I glance at appear to be simultaneously peacocking for attention but also totally embarrassed, haunted by the unexamined knowledge that as a maneuver in a culture war they paid $100,000 for a car that doesn't work?), though I saw one in the Santa Cruz mountains this past weekend. It looked even more jarringly synthetic and stupid in a truck-style environment, as if 10 seconds on a semi-paved road would undo the whole rickety car. I felt, amid standard-issue disgust and mockery, personal embarrassment to be paying through the nose to live in a place where the coolest thing you can do is cosplay as a 6-year-old's idea of the coolest guy in the world.""*

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I feel like the Cyber Truck is a defining vehicle for Tesla. Pre-Cyber Truck Tesla and Elon Musk were basically admired as mavericks and had a ton of goodwill. The intro of the Cyber Truck was pretty divisive. A good number of people hated it (rightfully so, IMO) but A lot of folks were kind of blinded to it's terribleness by the Tesla/Elon reputation. It just felt like, certainly there's more to this that we just don't understand yet or won't know until we see/drive it personally. It was like the Nicholas Cage of trucks, it's either incredible or terrible.

Then we all kind of came around to the truth of Elon. I know that I totally forgot about the Cyber Truck in the interim, and then one day they started delivering them. I think if people still liked Elon, the Cyber Truck would be getting the benefit of the doubt, as Teslas always have. But now that he's reached his final charlatan form, the rose colored glasses have come off and what once were quirks are now recognized as flaws. It's still the Nicholas Cage debate, but now we realize that he's been a racist sexual harasser his whole career and we never knew it.",0,,2024-04-16,0.1,0.127,0.1487

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Once Trump takes US out of the Paris Agreement and with Musk meddling in Europe, expect a big drop in sales in the US and EU countries. As for China, idk how much longer it can coast on reputation, battery tech wise they are behind the locals, at least on C rating and cost. Had they prepared with a 25k model for this or next year it would maybe make a splash in other developing countries, as is with the push for autonomous cars, it's heading towards bankruptcy. To be clear I have no doubt they can make ever improving level 3 systems, but at level 4 and 5 they need to be held accountable for any crash or incident, with the tech being so unreliable and unproven, the outcome can be no other.

The expectations for the next few years will be more range due to improved efficiency, shorter charging time of 10 minutes with 5C or better batteries and cheaper and better cars at the entry level, not i3 level ones but more like Bolt and Kona at around 20k or under. These and more are beyond what Tesla is pursuing at the moment.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I REALLY don’t understand why almost everyone thinks Tesla’s poor sales growth results are due to Elon’s politics.  The real reason is that every Tesla model now has competition from other manufacturers and there are MANY EV alternatives that are far superior to the Tesla models they compete against.  Tesla has failed to improve any of their models, has failed to introduce a lower cost model and they have removed features (turn stalks, rain sensors for wipers, etc) that all automotive buyers fully expect from any automobile.  And now that Tesla has opened its Super Charger network to non-Tesla vehicles, it has lost its only really strong positive product differentiator.  Musk’s political unpopularity is just a very small reason that Tesla keeps losing market share IMHO.",1,,2025-01-09,0.11,0.148,0.7764

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Quality, reliability, durability, value. Toyota’s old brand pillars will win this race too, as they always do in the long run. Too many manufacturers, Tesla included, have to relearn this lesson over and over again.

Even Toyota has lost the plot lately—the new Land Cruiser and those atrocious new engines in the U.S. market (sorry, fanboys) prove it. But no matter how far brands stray, these fundamentals always rise to the top.

People don’t flock to Speed Queen or pay the Miele premium because they’re trendy; they do it because those brands deliver. They want boots that last, appliances that don’t break, cars that don’t leave them stranded. They want reliability—something that’s becoming harder to find.

Meanwhile, you’ve got manufacturers like Tesla playing games with pricing, setting records for recalls that make your head spin, and idiots like Stellantis gutting quality while jacking up costs to the point where everyone is actually just laughing at their greed.

2025 is shaping up to be a hard year for Tesla. Musk's reputation is not in the least bit useful. Beyond that 2025 is the year that mass market affordable EVs arrive in both the EU and US that spells competition and falling sales. Competition cuts profit margins of course but given that the Models 3 and Y sold so well while there was a dearth of EVs to be had they are over represented on the roads. At least some potential buyers will select a different EV to avoid being lost in sea of sameness that is Tesla.

Then comes seasonality, China essentially shuts down for 2 weeks and car sales look like  they are crashing for the whole quarter. China's New Year moves around every year so even the year over year numbers look funny.",0,,2025-01-08,0.101,0.112,0.6573

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I'm fine with Roadie II having less range so long as it's fantastic on track. I want it to be able to drive four 20-30 minute sessions at 100% performance in a day. So that's about 20 minutes of 100% throttle and braking, then about an hour to recharge at the track (could be a 12kW generator, could be a Supercharger) then blast another session with zero (zero!) thermals and zero brake fade. 

So, fine by me if that's a 100kWh battery, so long as the Roadster is as light as possible and all the performance expectations (I don't need gas thrusters, but … : ) 

What I don't want in the Roadster is a flabby C curve and battery thermals. What I do want is crisp, precise handling, excellent steering feel and feedback, perfect suspension dynamics with complete control over setup.

Tesla should get a Porsche 992 GT3 RS and include every feature from chassis setup, fast and slow compression and rebound, to the driver electronics for brakes and abs thresholds, suspension, rear steer, body roll, active aero … and think about brakes and making space for wheel and tire selection, think about brakes that play nice with slicks, and an integrated roll cage and six point harnesses, and airbag defeat, and replacing the seats with race shells, fitting a koolshirt box, a radio, helmet ventilation, data telemetry … anticipate all these things that make it an expensive hassle to set up a street car for performance driving.

Actual battery capacity kWh is very important, but it's in terms of what is available under the right foot, not in terms of maximal iron-butt distance driving.",3,,2023-12-17,0.018,0.112,0.9786

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"The price is the way it is because Tesla knows the beginning orders are going to have enough demand to justify the price. When demand slows for the CT and scaling improves, they can lower the cost. It's common sense here. Why sell a vehicle that can sell tens of thousands of vehicles at $50k when they can sell it for $80k and still have the same unit sales? Also, when Tesla began advertising the CT, the Rivian and Lightning trucks weren't out yet so from their perspective, it makes sense to price the vehicles at a price their competitors are charging. The big differentiator here will be who can lower the price of their trucks and scale to profitably the quickest? And that will be Tesla.",7,,2023-12-01,0.058,0.04,0.0926

Tesla actually over promised in several areas which caused demand and constraints in pricing and battery availability.

Steer-by-wire is nice to have, but for me, it's not a ""got to have it"" feature. The R1T is right up there in performance and I'd argue that it and the Silverado/Sierra EV have more useful features that customers want.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"If they start producing a million a year …it won’t be long before they look like a Camaro (…remember 2010? They were wicked. Now, they are just another car). That being said, everyone and their grandma is going to be driving them around. Many people will be trading them in for the newer and newer models which will have slight improvements, meanwhile the used market will be massive…people with lower and lower budgets will be buying them…by then there will be some other exotic electric vehicles being introduced and many people will be switching over and/or going for those…then the cybertruck will get crazy affordable…New & used. 

All the other automakers are now getting with the times and getting on board with EVs and realizing that much of the US is now finally becoming interested in driving around something more than just a bland automobile.

The cybertruck looks cool now but for how long? I think that’s the better question.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"The production truck is vastly underwhelming compared to the original specs.   
The prototype had some neat features too that never made it to production:

1. Telescoping tailgate ramp

2. Storage in the rear sails

3. Digital rear view mirror

4. Extra cameras on either side of the license plate

5. T tracks in the vault bed

6. Front bench seat (seating for 6 total)

When you compare the CT to the F-150 or the Chevy Silverado/GMC Denali EV it's just not competitive enough in the utility department to warrant the price they're asking.   
  
I've spent 2 weeks driving a friend's CT and while the digital steering is neat it's just not a feature I'd want over a vastly larger front trunk with power outlets, better interior, more range and a better drive. My money would to go a GMC Sierra Denali EV. The range is just ""chef's kiss""",16,,2025-03-18,0.01,0.114,0.9401
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"The CT doesn't function as a truck. Towing range and non-towing range sucks. Lack of charging stations outside big urban areas. The exterior panels fit and finish vary widely, and some peel off. Quality is questionable and tends to brick itself. Service and repair has always been a problem with the brand.

The Cybertruck is a joke, played on its buyers who blindly crave, I guess, ""different"" and ""exclusive"" yet doesn't do anything well and a lot of things poorly.  It barely fits in a normal road lane. It looks like a cartoon. It does not do well off-road either. 

What's not to like?

On the other hand, Musk calls the sub-$30,000 EV that Tesla once proposed as being ""pointless"".",20,,2025-03-18,0.068,0.145,0.7523
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Even if you can somehow look beyond Elon today, the truck is more expensive with worse specs than when it was first announced, by quite a wide margin. The number of people able/willing to drop $80k on a truck is much smaller than those spending half that (the announced base price, which I'm confident we never actually see). 

There are EV trucks that go farther, and tow heavier. It really only competes with other EV trucks on payload. You can get almost all of them for less money too, especially with current dealer perks. 

The bed is a product of form over function, and its efficiency rating doesn't even really exceed that of competing trucks. It doesn't win the turn radius test of EV trucks (it does get close). Steer by wire is impressive, but I think not enough for most. 

Now throw all of the political influence of Musk in (agree or disagree that this is a ""problem"", it's effecting people's buying decisions), and you have a product that has become unattractive for a lot of people. Let's not forget that Tesla has lost quite a bit of market value, causing its own level of buyer uncertainty with the brand.",6,,2025-03-18,0.101,0.069,-0.845

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Trucks are supposed to be heavy-duty workhorses not a trumped up whatever a cybertruck is. These cybertrucks just don’t offer up any true advantage for those needing a truck. For those wanting to use them for recreational activities, they don’t go far enough with a tow to actually make it to a remote or decent camp ground or distant logging road without needing a charge - and those charging stations aren’t available in remote areas. Any that are available you have to wait… and wait… to charge… while a regular truck you can fill and go. They can only haul roughly the equivalent to an F150, which isn’t much in Truckworld. They don’t appeal to truck people because they really aren’t trucks. And they are unattractive to say the least.

Preorders opened in 2019 for a 2021 launch with a $69k top trim. They really started delivering to the public in 2024 for $120k.

Rivian opened pre-orders in 2018 for $67.5k with planned deliveries in 2020. They started deliveries in 22/23 at the promised price.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Funny how quickly articles go from tesla specific to EV hitpiece. 

I think the 3 issues are it's looks and the politics/elon's influence on the design, and the typical tesla initial build quality. Everything else people complain about(price, range, charging, towing, off roading, safety) is either debatable or exactly the same with other evs and especially ev trucks. If they fixed every single one of those issues people would still not buy them for reasons 1 and 2. 

 I really don't like the ""not a real truck"" argument for all ev trucks. People use trucks for other things than distance towing. I would love a bed so to not hook up my trailer every time I need a Home depot or furniture store run. The other trucks might be better or worse than the CT but they aren't selling either for the same  ""not a real truck"" reason

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Tesla deserves credit for adapting to the sales performance of the CyberTruck. Not many automakers would have been able to respond to 2M orders and 38K sales (2% conversion). Tesla, to their credit, did a reality check, and bit the bullet and split production of the MY in Fremont and moved a bunch of that production to Texas. With the recent efforts to maybe make 'new Teslas, robotaxis, etc' in Texas, they should be able to improve the utilization of the factory. In the near-term they can move some CTs with free lifetime charging and the $7500 rebates until those go away. Hard to imagine how much more difficult the sales will become when the rebate ends. By then, the 'new vehicles' might begin to show some demand to make up the difference.

Between Fremont and Shanghai, Tesla can make about 2M vehicles. It remains to be seen whether world wide demand can fill the plants (2024 was < 1.8M vehicles). This ignores the production at Berlin and Texas. I would imagine those investments were made when Elon was keen to move the HQ and had forecast Tesla building 20M cars by 2030. New smaller cars and the autonomy revolution can help a lot if they materialize. Fundamentally, poor plant utilization undermines margins.",1,,2025-03-18,0.065,0.072,0.5472

The exterior is the same story. They are not true stainless steel. It’s a low quality steel. Many of the panels are attached to the underbody with glue. GLUE. Which naturally causes them to fall apart. Throwing metal panels into traffic.

Anyway, in reddit fashion, respond to the headline:

* Tesla massively missed their own own launch specs & Pricing.
   * People were expecting a 500+ mile range, 14000lb towing, 3500lb payload cybertruck for $70k, and got a 320 mile range, 11000lb towing, 2500lb towing cybertruck for $100k
   * Early prototypes had 6 seats. Only a 5 seat version made it to production.
   * The final design includes things like windscreen wiper, wing mirrors, larger bumpers, so does not look quite a futuristic as the concept.
* Tesla were years late to market compared to what was expected
   * Late 2021 production was planned, but production started 2 years late in Nov 2023.
   * It is now 2025 and the cheapest RWD version is still not available.
   * Tesla were expected to be first to market (other than high priced Rivian), but when by the time they hit the market, there was lots of coemption in the space.
* Economic conditions have changed.
   * People were a lot more willing to spend on EV's in the buoyant economic conditions' and high oil price environment of say late 2022
   * Auto industry as a whole has issues. Massive overproduction of high priced vehicles vs consumer demand in the current environment. Ram 1500, 2500,. 3500 all have 200+ days sales of cars on hand.
* $100 deposits turn out to be a poor metric of actual sales
* An international launch was expected, but currently the cybertruck is only available in north America

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"They're hot garbage, that's why.  But there are other reasons.

Truckbros want to be able to personalize their trucks: not easily done with a Cyberjunk.  You can paint it - thus covering up one of its greater unique features, the stainless skin.  You can fly your Confederate/Traitor flag from it, but that's not exactly distinctive.  And uh...that's about it.  Is anyone building a lift kit for these things?  Or bolting a loud exhaust?

Actually I would love to market extra-loud exhausts for Cyberjunks; parting fools from their money is its own reward, multiplying by zero is just icing on the cake.

They're actually kind of fragile and piss-poor at a lot of the Big Boi Truck posing that actual trucks do.  Fording streams, rolling coal, surviving car washes - Cyberjunks aren't proven winners at these feats.

And of course Tesla's association with its alt-right Totally Not A Nazi Service Dodging Illegal Immigrant CEO isn't improving matters.  It might win with MAGAts who have already blinded their eyes to their Dear Leader's many failings, what's one more, right?  But it doesn't win over any treehuggers, people even slightly open to middle grounds or, gasp, liberalism in any way, shape or form.

So, to wrap up: they're terrible trucks.  And lots of people don't like the associations they bring.",1,,2025-03-18,0.158,0.101,-0.9195

Musk has been fanning Nazis and currently the face of Tesla. 

The Cybertruck pretends to he a pickup truck and marketed that way but it does not look like a truck. Pickup truck market is a different beast and Tesla missed it.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"""Supposed to rule the roads"" is kind of indicative of the problem they have (as well as other EVs to some extent). Media hype does not equal actual hype and, with this variety of vehicle, promises made by the media and these companies have not followed suit with actual real world performance.

As a good example, my team at work was afforded the opportunity to benchmark a Rivian the other day. It was extremely fast and had impressive safety tech with an aesthetically pleasing interior. That's about it for positives. The vehicle cost well over $100k but looked like $20k or less from outside as it showed a lot of clear indications that the company is kinda just new to making cars (Rivian has had good partners here and is better than Tesla's many more issues with the same thing). Body panels don't line up, drain tracks are for show, door handle enshitification, etc etc.

Most importantly, we wanted to understand its fuel economy as this is kind of the big argument for these vehicles aside from sports car performance. Rivian advertises between 60-80MPGe for these vehicles. Incredible if true. Our road test found very different numbers. Based on fuel price (charge station near work) it ran ~8MPGe during our ~80 miles of testing. Rerunning the numbers through an EPA formula for MPGe using kwh, they'd call it 10MPGe (the MPGe formula is complete bunk in practice but it happened to give a decent estimate when used in this way). Their claims that we could charge it from a standard wall outlet with the adapter were nonsense as well. We tried, but the truck gave us an infinite time estimate so it at best stabilized things.

The charge process was awful as well. It cost far more than advertised and took 2 hours to charge back 80 miles of use. This led to us running the math and exploring what exactly MPGe is a measure of, as we had a lot of time to kill to think about it. Long and short, speaking as a physicist, it's complete bunk. The EPA estimates MPGe by comparing traveling distance of the EV to that of an ICE vehicle for one gallon of gas using an equivalent amount of energy contained in one gallon of gas for the EV. On the surface, that seems sensible, but it's actually treating the EV as adjacent to a free energy machine as it's purposefully leaving out the entire process of generating the power while factoring that in for the ICE vehicle. If your area isn't backboned by renewables (most of the US) you're actually loosing the majority of this free energy during the generation process that puts it in a usable form for the vehicle. As an example, if your area burns coal as a power source that coal plant is its own ICE that runs comparable efficiency as a car, but burns dirtier fuel and falls behind the efficiency of ICE vehicles as you transport that energy and run it through a charger. For these areas, a real world MPGe estimate is closer to a quarter of the EPA's estimate. If it's winter factor in another 30% loss due to degraded battery function in the cold.

We all came away with roughly the same opinion. Cool vehicle but ""who the hell is this for!?"" It's a fast SUV that's just a people hauler, lacks other capability, gets equivalent fuel economy to a fully loaded semi-truck, charging it away from your home is a nightmare and I'd have to rewire/dedicate an entire portion of my property to charging the thing there (dealer estimated $10-$15k for charger installation).

This is why EVs aren't selling like forecast, especially your high end brands like Tesla, Rivian, etc. They're definitely the future, but the current results don't stack up. In reality, it's pretty clear after driving/measuring one that the hype is just that at best and pushing on outright fraud at worst (I'm looking at you ""MPGe""). Other than some of the smaller economy ones that can kind of argue fuel efficiency, they don't provide a benefit outside of being flashy vroom vroom machines for tech bros that don't care about actual function.

Do you want to spend $125k to get a truck that can barely do truck things, might burn you alive in a 4000° fire if you bottom out while trying to do truck things and can't find the secondary hidden door handle, gets the fuel economy of a fully loaded semi, has poor assembly tolerance to the point of making it look like a toy, is genuinely difficult to fuel up on the go, and the company has made it pretty clear that they're already lying to you as real world tests fail to reproduce advertised range, fuel economy, etc? No. Nobody wants that.

Also, Elon reposting propaganda from a certain hate group involved in a large war from the past has turned a lot of people off of his company. (This message got flagged for including the name of said hate group....... Cool community guidelines....)",0,,2025-03-18,0.096,0.127,0.9623

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Nobody knows for sure so it’s all conjecture. I think the answer we agree with also is very influenced by how we feel about the truck. I have a hard time believing the majority of the people thought they were going to get a newly developed full sized truck with a SS exoskeleton for $40,000. I believe a huge percentage of the reservation holders wouldn’t have bought it even at that price. Availability has gone up and prices are way down and yet there is no spike in sales. I don’t like the truck so I’m surprised they sold as many as they did. I think the more interesting question is whether or not there is a price that the truck will sell, where Tesla can make a profit. Even at a much lower price where more will see it as a good value it will still be expensive. How many people really will feel like they need the truck and don’t mind the stigma? Conservatives might tolerate the CT with Musk being the first buddy, but do they want a flashy electric truck?

You know how in a dream, most of what goes on is pretty weird,  but your dreaming consciousness doesn't pay it any mind?

in this case, not much out of the ordinary was  occurring - everything made sense, so I thought I wasn't dreaming.

The jist of the dream was that one of my investments had hit it big and I was up $60,000

First thing I thought to do was put it towards a cybertruck.Soon as I contacted Tesla, I was woken up by my dogs, who needed to go out.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"One of the more challenging consequences of Mr Musk's personality type is he cannot share the spotlight. BYD started out making Nokia phone batteries and graduated to making iPads. They were making less than 500K NEVs per year in 2020 when the tidal wave of their growth emerged. They have since overwhelmed everyone in China including Tesla. They will certainly make 5.5M vehicles this year and perhaps more. That will be about 3X of Tesla production. They introduced a cool car this year called the YangWang U8 which can navigate through water. Shortly thereafter Musk started with the late night fantasy talk of CyberTruck as a boat. He cannot resist. Here's a link of the amazing vehicle in question. Not sure it looks cooler than a CyberTruck though :) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoW1pNHEhLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoW1pNHEhLo)

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"If the choice is between CT and F150, that's one of personal choice.  But they're not fighting against each other, they're tag teaming against RAM and the Silverado.  Hell, even the F150 ICE is the opponent on this.  Each truck EV on the road is one less ICE truck on the road.

The looks are going to be a big factor.  The design of the CT is very polarizing.  Either you love it or you don't.  Big pickups, this is how they've looked for years, and truck people like that.  I know a ton of truck people.  Most of them follow the same pattern.  Buy the biggest, best, most equipped pickup they can afford, pay it off as fast as possible, mod the hell out of it, and drive it till it dies.  Rinse and repeat.

You want to get more EV's on the road, the Lightning will do that.  It will convert that person or that family that was thinking of the normal F150 or Silverado or Ram when they see everything else it can do.  The CT will bring in the coastal people and younger generations.  The Lightning will work wonders in Middle America.",584,,2021-05-27,0.065,0.086,0.5522

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I've never been that concerned about the car occupants' safety; Tesla historically has performed extremely well on that front. I think the biggest concern of mine here (one which the oversized ICE trucks all share) is *pedestrian* safety. Here in the US, pedestrian deaths have been skyrocketing for the last decade, and the absurd size of trucks and SUV's is a major reason why. The cybertruck looks purpose designed to be a pedestrian killer. As somebody who uses a wheelchair, there's a ton of trucks and SUV's on the road that I'm completely invisible to, because they wouldn't see me if I were walking in front of them in the crosswalk.

Of course, the real issue here is that NHTSA barely does any pedestrian safety evaluation at all. While that's [currently being worked on](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-proposes-new-crashworthiness-pedestrian-protection-testing-program) at NHTSA, I'd still hope to see automakers start paying attention to the safety of folks *outside* of their vehicles today -- not when regulation forces them to do so.",34,,2023-12-02,0.024,0.104,0.908
Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Just because everyone is moving from being epidemiologists, to legal scholars, historians, and now crash test experts; remember that vehicle safety testing is a self-certification process in which vehicles are safety tested by their manufacturers.

NHTSA does not approve vehicles for sale in the United States; manufacturers approve their own vehicles when they feel the vehicle meets standards laid out by NHTSA.  

Later, NHTSA may do some testing on a sample of the product from “the fleet” (meaning they go buy one), and check if that sample meets standards; but that would be after thousands or tens of thousands are sold.

> The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Vehicle Safety Act), NHTSA’s organic
statute, creates a **self-certification system of compliance, in which vehicle and equipment
manufacturers certify that their products meet applicable standards.** NHTSA chooses vehicles
and equipment **from the fleet** to test for compliance, and pursues enforcement actions when the
Agency finds either a non-compliance or a defect posing an unreasonable risk to safety.

> **NHTSA does not pre-approve new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle technologies.** NHTSA
will continue to exercise its available regulatory authority over Automated Driving Systems (or
ADS) using its existing regulatory tools: interpretations, exemptions, notice-and-comment
rulemaking, and defects and enforcement authority. NHTSA has the authority to identify safety
defects, **allowing the Agency to recall vehicles** or equipment that pose an unreasonable risk to
safety even when there is no applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).

> **It is important to note that NHTSA does not prohibit the introduction of new motor vehicles or
motor vehicle technologies into the vehicle fleet,** provided those vehicles and technologies meet
existing FMVSS.1 A vehicle or equipment manufacturer need ask NHTSA about a new
technology or vehicle design **only when** it will not comply with applicable standards, or when
there might be a question as to compliance. If a manufacturer anticipates having such a question,
then requests for interpretations, exemptions, and rulemakings are the methods that a
manufacturer can use to pursue answers from the Agency. Occasionally, some of these
regulatory tools have taken several months to several years for NHTSA to issue, but the Agency
has committed to expediting its actions regarding automation.

> To aid regulated entities and the public in understanding the use of the Agency’s regulatory tools
(including the introduction of new ADS), NHTSA has prepared an information and guidance
document. This document, which has wider application beyond automation, provides
instructions, practical guidance, and assistance to entities seeking to employ those tools.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I investigate crashes at work. I’ve been the lead investigator in almost 300 crashes and assisted with at least another 1,000 investigations. Honestly this doesn’t seem as gas as you might think. 

You have to consider that this isn’t like hitting a car when you’re going 35mph. The truck is hitting a solid wall. That means the damage would be far worse than an actual collision at 35mph (unless the truck did in fact hit a wall). Someone posted the comparison video with the F150, and it was comparable to that. 

The truth is that every auto collision is VIOLENT! We just usually don’t notice how violent because it happens so quickly. If you were in that car, and in that crash, you would probably only have minor injuries.",17,,2023-12-03,0.152,0.063,-0.9374

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"The entire real axle bent and snapped like a wishbone on thanksgiving. lol

I’m not a physicist but I would imagine that means the stainless steel design is not absorbing much energy, and it looks like crash tests of cars from the 60s-70s. The way the front fenders flare out and the small crumple zone mixed with the materials used seems to be detrimental to the design safety. I would be surprised to see this car boast a class-leading safety rating as their other models do.

But also, safety aside, that seems like quite an expensive repair…

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Message to shareholders: What ethical person would buy a Tesla EV?  
  
Elon Musk, a 53-year-old billionaire and father of 12, replied to Swift's endorsement of Harris::  
  
*“Fine Taylor… you win… I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.”*

Hillary Clinton condemns Elon Musk’s ‘creepy’ message to Taylor Swift: ‘Another way of saying rape’  


Dangerous Elon Musk:

X owner Elon Musk's reshare of a manipulated, faux campaign ad for Vice President Kamala Harris on social media last week raised alarms because he did not disclose that the clip, which parroted rightwing takes about the likely Democratic nominee, was a parody. Musk reposted the manipulated video of Harris to X on Friday night. The clip, which used much of the same imagery from her first presidential campaign ad, featured a new voice-over that appeared to be digitally altered to sound like Harris.  
  
*“I, Kamala Harris, am your Democrat candidate for president because Joe Biden finally exposed his senility at the debate,” the voice says in the clip. ""I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire. I'm both a woman and a person of color, so if you criticize anything I say, you're both sexist and racist.""*",0,,2024-09-20,0.099,0.045,-0.8993

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I had a pre-order that I then cancelled.

I had a few reasons:

1. 2+ years of delay killed enthusiasm. The CT isn’t a practical car for most people, and that sinks in when you have 2 years to mull on it.

2. The resale market for CT is abysmal so I’d never buy it new if I ever bought it

3. Elon + Tesla marketing deliberately deceived us about the 500mi range tri-motor. Tesla engineers knew this was never going to happen. That deception burned a lot of trust for me.

4. Poor quality control

5. Tough competition. Rivian, Scout, Hummer, Ford, Chevy, etc.

6. Interest rates are much higher now than when I pre-ordered

I’m not against Tesla or the CT (I still respect they built something that crazy). But I’m not a fan boy, either. I just got bored waiting for 2 years and there are other, cooler cars to follow.",363,,2025-01-15,0.118,0.048,-0.8291

There are 24 in inventory (at a discounted price) between the only 2 delivery centers within a 200 mile radius of my house.

What does that equate to nationwide? A thousand sitting on lots? More?

The truck had an estimated 2 million pre-orders. People were wondering if they'd get their truck within 6 years of placing an order. In less than 14 months they went from 1st delivery to discounted inventory ready for immediate pick up.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"The knots people twist themselves in to argue the utility of the cybertruck are fascinating. 

This is a novelty. The entire purpose was to be novel. There are simpler, off the shelf ways to do everything this truck supposedly does well. I think this vehicle will lead the way to burying the entire US automotive industry. It has been successful so far and the formula will be copied by other automotive brands. But I think cars like this are pushing things too far. I think once you make stupid novelties this expensive, people might snap out of the keeping up with the joneses stupor and realize that a novelty isn’t worth getting into dangerous levels of debt over. And maybe they’ll realize that most cars are just novelties.",5,,2025-01-15,0.094,0.093,-0.5023

That same day, Musk was tweeting from Hawaii while he was vacationing. 
From my nephews account, there were so many issues with that truck. He counted minimum 30 units he raised flags about with issues with the dash screen not functioning properly and his line supervisor told him to just put the components in and to not stop the line as it would be too disruptive.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"It's a polarising vehicle. That said, at it's cheapest it has come in significantly higher priced than the promised $39,900, at $60,990. That removes a whole raft of interested people. I mean, easily way more than half the 2 million reservations. So it surprises me slightly that they are pretty much into ordinary sales so quickly, but we have to include the invisible variable - Elon Musk, and his radicalised politics. Cybertruck was meant to be a fun vehicle, but is also a zero-emissions vehicle. The latter generally appeals to centre/centre left politically thinking people, who are now severely pissed off with Musk. They are simply not backing him and not buying is a way of showing it. The US right wing thinking public mainly wouldn't buy a BEV if you paid them to, even with Musk backing Trump.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Turns out when you significantly underdeliver on range while significantly increasing the price, your customer base is much smaller than anticipated. 

Tesla needs to bring out the RWD model and reduce all trim level pricing by $15-$20k if they want to produce high volumes. Obviously you only want to do that after exhausting initial demand. 

I think the same could be said for the Lightning. If the price had stayed around $40K for the entry model, I have no doubt that the volumes would be triple what they are now. (They would also need to lower the pricing of their other trim levels.) Hell, right now they aren’t even offering the entry model! With battery cost contouring to fall, I’m wondering why Ford can’t reduce the price even further.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"To the folks saying ""It's a marketing gimmick"".

Guys.  Grow up.

*Any* company that can find a way to publicize how their product can be used for good, is going to publicize how their product can be used for good.

Here's an older example from [Dawn dish soap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPsRiTyvLqU) about how their product is used to get oil off of birds in an oil spill

You can rummage around online and find all kinds of examples like this.

[Verizon](https://www.wptv.com/news/national/verizon-apologizes-for-throttling-service-firefighters-fighting-wildfires-lifts-data-caps) literally took a bunch of shit for lifting data caps like six years ago to help wildfire people.

*If* what they're doing is provided a *good* for society, then who cares what the intent is?  Let's move on with life.",1,,2025-01-13,0.027,0.148,0.9344

> Yes. Please be careful in some areas, as there is non-zero risk of armed looters. 

> Cybertruck side panels are bulletproof to subsonic projectiles (handguns, shotgun & Tommy gun), but the glass is not, so make sure to duck if you see anyone wielding a gun.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Wifi has a very limited range. They would need to put an access point/truck every !~100ft to acheive any reasonable coverage with a ""grid pattern"".

This is great for those that need it, but it's a marketing stunt to claim a grid of cybertrucks is providing a grid of access points for an entire region. Unless they are sending like 10,000+ trucks. Are humans driving those trucks or autopilot?

Those who signed a contract for a truck, expecting delviery, are finding their contract is now overridden by another Telsa priority.

The only things I know that could cause rusting in the bare grained Steel are either an application of a corrosive agent(bleach or salt water) or for a contaminant piece of regular metal that creates an infection point for rust to start.  Something has to bypass or strip away the exterior Chromium layer to start the rusting process.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"I'm reminded of how people that believe in a flat earth or creationism think it's important to be able to ""hear both sides"" of a story. As if they're coming into the discussion with equal levels of credibility from the outset.


For example people that hang out on Reddit are an overall rather left leaning bunch. Then you combine that with subs like ones focused on EVs and you really put the sifters on weeding out a large group of people from the discussion.


Those same people you've weeded out? What do you think the percentage is that own a pickup truck? Versus your *average"" EV fan redditor.


So it's like, even when you see a guy in here talk about how he thinks the cybertruck is great, and he's going to replace his 1 ton Ram with one or whatever, that's still not a significant indicator of the actual market.


You can point to all of the people in this sub who say they know a guy in their town that has one, or that they've just ordered one and it ignores the *millions* of people who laugh at it still. The actual target market, no less.


Like when they made that list of scientists who believe in creationism and then the eye-rolling response was to limit the rebuttal list of scientists to only people with the first name Steve.",-3,,2025-01-09,0.031,0.094,0.9406

I like using FSD to reduce highway fatigue especially on long trips, and if I have a relatively straight forward non busy drive on side roads I’ll activate it, but it has very, very low utility for me in rush hour, busy streets, confusing streets or anything in rain or snow.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"FSD definitely reduces long distance fatigue for me. But this is an example of why some level 2 ADAS might not actually be safer than regular driving.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Someone posted these on Twitter but I don’t have the link to it. I saw it on FB so if someone has the source please link it here.

Edit- 

Differences I noticed:
- windshield wiper is massive!
- has mirrors
- no wheel covers
- bed looks smaller? Not sure. Actually it might be the same size but now the top part covers part of the bed so from above it looks smaller.
- no door handles? There is something on the b/c pillar that looks new. Could be to open the door.
- inside side of bed has holes for pins. Similar to what Rivian has for modular attachments.
- charge port has been moved. It’s no longer on the side panel but maybe on the black frame above the wheel. There is a cut in that area.
- tow hitch is visible
- 3 small amber lights in the front are new
- marble dash look is now gone
- light bar could be gone

Also found the video here [https://youtu.be/8NkRT_y9zms](https://youtu.be/8NkRT_y9zms). CT footage starts at around the 1 minute mark.

Elon on wipers and mirrors - [Manufacturers have to ship cars with side mirrors by law, but owners are allowed to modify their cars.  The wiper is what troubles me most. No easy solution. Deployable wiper that stows in front trunk would be ideal, but complex.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1469371515430912004?s=21)

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Windshield looks more curved than the original, indicating Tesla made the change to decrease drag. Curved windshields allow the air to flow up and over the vehicle in a more subtle motion than flat windshields.

Personal take from someone who works with optical properties every day: Cybertruck windshield will be like no other. Elon going heavy on the no mirrors thing tells me the patent tesla filed to join two different glass compositions will play a big role in heads up displays. It’s speculation, but I think Cybertruck will have high index of refraction glass for the interior A pillars giving an AR style HUD and video feed for mirrors.

The wiper is hideous. I would take a hit in drag coefficient for the typical wiper bay under windshield.",31,,2021-12-10,0.051,0.082,0.5023

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"You can definitely see that is the windshield from the Tesla Glass promo video that came out a month ago. It looks slightly curved compared to the original CT’s “very straight” piece of glass. I like it. 

Not sure about the windshield wiper though. I assume it’s meant to just go horizontally across the windshield from left to right…and I guess the benefit is that in anything except a torrential downpour, you’d maintain sight lines out of the vehicle through any part of the windshield.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"That final bullshit of Elon vs Buffet should have just been removed... It makes the entire article seem stupid.

Every other point was fair: The CT, as it is now, is in a pre-release state.  Owners of the Truck purchased it, and paid extra for the pre-release, for this specific reason. (Telsa branding them as 'Foundation' series... which is a great thing they did, as it flags these trucks as 1st gen and makes them easier to avoid in the used market going forward).

I wouldn't want to cover a product that is, basically, a beta product.

The CT has a long road before it's really considered an ""Official"" release.  While there are minor issues to fix (leaking 'Vaults' aren't major issues) the bigger ones are things like the small control arms, inadequate/undersized air-compressor for the shock system, weakness in the tow frame, and the flimsy a-frame steel coming off during highway travel.

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"Understandably, this place is filled with Tesla haters. But Tesla continues to do things that no one else is. Keep in mind that these missed deadlines are on projects much bigger and more complicated than anybody else is taking on. And they continually make huge progress. 

Let’s review what they have already currently accomplished:

- most efficient batteries (no other EV has as much range while producing as much acceleration - compare the EV6 to model 3 trim levels
- easily the best driver assist software anybody can buy (and ongoing RAPID progress) - compare to GM, Ford, etc. check a recent YouTube video on the performance
- most widespread and actually functioning charging network (the other chargers are always breaking)
- easily the best infotainment software - see how smooth it operates and intuitive with a screen compared to other software efforts from automakers
- they sell the best selling CAR (not just EV) in the world. Model Y sells more than any other. 

Tesla is in the EV lead position and their lead continues to grow. The next EV they release will be an affordable $25k car and will eliminate any competition (GM, VW, Ford, Toyota, Honda will all struggle to stay in business) because no one else will be able to make an affordable economy EV without losing tons of money per car. 

Rest assured, the Cybertruck will come out and sell at least decently well. And be a reminder that they are here to stay and win. 

All of these criticisms of Tesla in this massive thread aren’t wrong but they are irrelevant. They’re growing rapidly and when they eventually address these issues they will create the best cars at the best price.",1,,2023-10-15,0.056,0.204,0.9956

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"LoL

""Having said that, something interesting here is that in Q4 2024, Tesla only sold 23,640 “other model” vehicles. These include the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck.

Tesla says the Model S and Model X lines at the Fremont, California plant can produce 100,000 vehicles, and the Cybertruck line at Giga Texas has an installed capacity for 125,000 trucks per year.

These three vehicles together should sell 225,000 units per year; however, the Q4 23,640 delivery means less than 100,000 units of Tesla Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck deliveries annually.

Even more concerning, the “other model” category generated almost the same 23,000 sales in Q4 2023. This was before Tesla barely started delivering Cybertrucks. Fast-forward a year, and Tesla is selling the same number of “other model” vehicles despite ramping up Cybertruck production.

Based on this data, the Cybertruck does not appear to be creating a new market for Tesla; instead, it seems to be cannibalizing Model S and Model X sales.""",279,,2025-01-30,0.0,0.053,0.7906

Comment,Tesla Cybertruck,"A short story: some time ago, a wee car called ‘cybersuck’ intrigued the minds of 3 year olds when it was released, as it was reminiscent of something they’d draw. But just as the car started traipsing the streets having its first moments of joy, the car encountered a touch of moisture and a brown residue formed on its stainable candy shell. Disappointed and mildly confused but undeterred, it decided to have a shot at towing but the bumper ripped off like a fresh scab. This hurt. Most of all he was embarrassed. It looked around at the other cars and decided its DNA must have mutated while it was being conceived. Maybe its creator had been too busy spewing carbon from his Leer while he played video games, or maybe he was too busy helping design Project 2025, or maybe he spent too many days posting vulgarities on X. In any case the cybersuck, chivalrous as you’d expect it to be, decided driving probably not in his or others’ best interest. So instead he decided to sit for the remainder of his life. Maybe he’d be lucky enough to encounter a massive flood, fire or mudslide to take away his misery. So he sat in a large boneyard, somehow still lonely among 130 thousand other cyberskeletons. Eventually they all became so forelorn, they decided they would commit mass self-unaliving. So they activated themselves and proceeded with their plan. Several decided to become dumpsters sitting outside HQ. Other dumpsters lit themselves on fire in protest of their creator. There were a few holdouts, however, lighting themselves on fire not to reach the afterlife but rather to stand in solidarity as burning symbols of the fascist Dumpster Fire himself. Eventually, the last few lined up in front of a firing squad and ushered in the shots. Ironically none actually died as they are all “bulletproof”, but they did become pockmarked like Martian dirt. These survivors decided as a last ditch effort, to join the next rocket to the Red Planet and donate their bodies as a sheet metal repository. So in the end, they decided being alive was worth it after all.",5,,2025-01-30,0.131,0.119,-0.4897

I've heard complaints from many people about how C&B fights them on the reserve and pushes sellers for a stupidly low reserve or no reserve. The fact that they allowed this stupidly high reserve is so dumb.

But what's dumber is that someone put in that bid.

The seller was a complete smart ass, and instead of facing the important questions with honest answers, Cars and Bids decided to not only flag comments, but delete tons of comments and ban users from commenting that were asking the really pertinent questions. 

I heard if you asked about the absent Carfax, they immediately banned your account from commenting. When you check the Carfax website, they definitely have a Carfax for this VIN, but for some reason Cars and Bids wanted to keep it hidden and pretend it didn't exist.

The seller was insinuating that he was the second owner after his dad, which allowed him to sell the car. The Carfax would show that if it were true.

Cars and Bids really exposed that their auctions are shady and they are not to be trusted with this one auction. It was a suspicious before, but now the cat is out of the bag.",31,,2024-03-22,0.125,0.067,-0.8983

I worry most for cars and bids. I have yet to see them in the news for a high price. I only see articles about how cheap a car sold for on there. First the $25k GR86 with no issues and now this.

They couldn’t just flatout say people cant sell it(due to legality issue i assume?)

I forgot what podcast but essentially if i remember correctly it was like tesla said for one year tesla have to say yes you can resell it, and that even if tesla says yes, tesla gets the first dib on buying back(and they are not going to pay the flipped price),

In that podcast it said essentially you can “get” the CT by seller NOT transferring title, insurance, any doc work to the new owner. So for a year seller holds all legal documents saying the seller is the owner.

Buyer have to take leap of faith that the seller isn’t going to just take the money and not transfer anything to you after a year.

Only real difference is that the outer ""rain slick"", or whatever you want to call it, appears to be darker in the customer images, and ""looser"", but that might be attributed to the fact that they put it together in the rain and don't have it all secured and such.

The only issue I see with it is the $3k price tag -which is insane for a tent.  

To be fair, Tesla doesn’t overcharge and gouge their customers, as they clearly offer cars at a fraction of other car company prices.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pros:

* More than a pickup truck. Good family car, particularly with the addition of the large frunk compared to ICE
* Roomy. 3 seats in back with room left for a dog. Big back seat. 
* Back seats fold up and the back is a HUGE cargo area. Makes up for smaller bed.
* Cheaper to operate (assuming charge at home) compared to ICE F-150, making it an option as a daily driver
* Affordable, compares in price to many larger EVs out there and lowest price electric pickup. Best value for the utility, IMO
* Access to Tesla supercharger network (but strongly prefer charging at home)
* Smooth, quiet ride. It's a dream to drive, especially with Adaptive Cruise Control on in traffic. 
* The torque!

Cons:

* Towing range sucks. Probably not what you want if you tow regularly at any distance over 50 miles or so. 
* Small bed (5.5ft). But frunk and back seat area make up for it IMO
* Poor aero mean poor efficiency even when not towing compare to other EVs. 
* If you can't charge at home regularly, I would not recommend EV at all. Public charging is a convenience, not something you want to depend on. 

The cons don't apply to me personally. I love just about everything about the Lightning. Only thing I'm changing is the shifter. I hate the bulky shifter and am planning to put in a dial shifter from another Ford. But some people like the traditional shifter.",20,,2024-09-18,0.083,0.091,0.3132

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"If you are driving gas trucks and have been used to towing and long haul driving, then you might not be able to appreciate lightening and might be quickly frustrated with it. It almost designed for some large SUV drivers wanting go electric. The range, with or without tow, can’t compete with a gas car. For mostly local works, that won’t go beyond 200miles a day, the truck is a delight to drive. If you have a L2 AC charger installed at home, then you will find you never care about gas prices anymore.",7,,2024-09-18,0.059,0.064,0.1461

* It's the smoothest vehicle I've ever been in—truck or otherwise.

* Expensive upfront cost.
* Public charging can be inconvenient if you can't charge at home.
* Ford isn't a software company. While I don’t mind the current software, earlier versions have had legitimate issues, according to what others have said.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"good:

Fast - I smash hellcats to 100ft and can pull on most cars on the road with the instant power while they figure out the shift 

Spacious - I roll around with 2 crazy border collies all day

Towing - similar to fast, I can tow 8000# like I'm driving a Miata.

Cheap to travel if you're home charging, and Tesla's network opens up the darn near the entire country to travel.

It's basically a street spec f150

not so good -

Heat, towing, and general hard driving kills mileage - but it's never been a real issue for me besides lots of stops on road trips during which driving frugally doesn't really save much spark.

Charging on long trips is nearly impossible without a supercharger adapter.  For example all the DC fast chargers in Redding CA were tampered with or down on my first road trip, I used a destination charger for two hours to get to Chico's crowded fast chargers.

I paid more for my XLT than people are now paying for Lariats - not some much a problem as me being impulsive at the worst time.

I dunno why they advertise it leveled out then sell you a truck that's bitched forward substantially, and the decent lowering kit is 10% the price of the truck or your stuck with a rough riding eibach kit to lower.  I do not want to lift-level an EV, I wanted a true Lightning f150 like Brian's from the Racers Edge - but single cab long bed built to rip vs the goofy step side.

Just my opinions here, I love this truck despite overpaying.",6,,2024-09-18,0.116,0.062,-0.9309

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Okay -- basically the Lightning is an F-150 with an all-electric drive train.  It drives and handles great for a pickup truck (honestly, the best pickup I've ever driven) but in the end it is a full-size pickup truck.  On the pro side, it is good for hauling stuff -- you have a 5'6"" bed plus a grocery-cart-sized frunk and room for 5 adults.  On the con side, it is a full-size pickup truck and doesn't fit easily in urban parking garages or narrow alleys.

As a BEV, you *absolutely* have to have way to charge regularly while you're doing something else.    For most folks, that means charging at home while you sleep.  This is the biggest advantage of an EV: you come home, plug in, and go about your evening.  Tomorrow morning you're charged back up without you having to do or think about anything.  *You never realized how annoying it is to run to the gas station until you never have to do it again.*

There are a few markets in the US where electricity is more expensive than gas.  In general, if 10 kWh of electricity costs *less* than 1 gallon of gas, then you'll save money driving on electrons.  For example, where I live electricity is $0.14 per kWh, so 10 kWh costs $1.40.  This is less than gas (at $3.30), so I save driving on electricity.  I save even more because my electric company has a deal for $0.08 per kWh if I charge late at night.

So, if you own your home and park in a garage, carport, or private driveway then you're probably good (you may have to get an electrician to install a circuit for you).  If you're in a condo or rental situation, check with your landlord or owners' association before you proceed.  A *few* lucky people have reliable free- or low-cost charging at work, and that is a solution too.

Aside from the charging situation, there are a few use cases that the Lightning doesn't really support.  If you regularly (once a week or more) drive more than about 250 miles a day, you may find even the ER truck has a frustratingly short range.  The same is true if you often (once a month or more) tow more than 150 miles a day.  Finally, if you road trip, be aware that you'll get about an 80:20 split between drive time and charging time -- you can expect trips to take about 25% longer than in a gas vehicle, and you should expect to pre-plan road trips like a pilot pre-plans a multi-hop flight.",5,,2024-09-18,0.031,0.109,0.9894
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"All the Cons. 
1. You don’t qualify for tax credits
2. You tow or drive long distance often
3. You rent or live in an apartment or condo (charging access)
4. You live in a high cost electric state/region (little to no gas savings)

Otherwise, Rock on!",5,,2024-09-18,0.039,0.056,0.2193
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"It tows a lot smoother than a F350 (considering the springs are lighter), but doesn't have quite the weight to stay as stable on heavier loads. I have to squeeze the trailer brake every little bit when hauling cattle, when they shift around it is enough to start a little fish tail, but I also don't use a weight distribution hitch, just a 2 3/8 ball or whatever size it is. Works great, but only get around 1 mile/kWh so around 120-130 miles round trip. 

As a grocery getter, it does a lot better. I get around 3 miles/kWh in town, including a 1 mile drive on highway to my house. Costs me $2.23 to go 100 miles just getting groceries and $6.69 to tow 100 miles when charging at home.

With the FCSP, I can top up from 45% to 85% in around 2-3 hours. 15%-85% in 5-6 hours. The range is only a factor on long trips otherwise normally the most I drive in a day is around 100 miles. More often 50 or less. Just top up once a week or every day or two when driving a bunch. 

Road trips aren't bad, just take longer to get there. Added around 9 hours when I went the the eclipse in April 650 miles away, and 4 hours of them were waiting for an EA stall with only 2 chargers operating and 4 cars that were completely dead in front of me. But otherwise, most stops were a half hour at most and half of it was getting food in the gas station or wandering a mall. Then I'd just catch up on my phone the rest of the time, snaps, Reddit, etc. Around $30-40 a stop. 

My main complaints are fighting the computer to use the screen and features I need, and the truck really struggles running inductive loads in the bed with the 30 amp cap for starting current on motors. Motor might only pull 4 amps when running, but pull 40 to start. So it trips, or has a large voltage drop (I've seen it down to 90 volts on 120v outlets before when starting a motor). Blue Cruise/lane centering hate glasses and will brake check you even when you're watching the road, to make you watch the road ...

Overall, it's fantastic. There's a few things that are annoying about it, but nothing that makes me regret buying it. I love it, and as long as use case doesn't require it (gooseneck, grain hauling with semis, tractors, etc.) I'll probably never buy ICE again.",4,,2024-09-18,0.081,0.064,-0.8132
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Compared to Tesla's offering (Cybertruck):

Ford: 

* Ford wins on build quality so far from what I've seen. I trust the truck won't literally fall apart.
* Ford wins on affordability so far--- and availability. You can roll down to a dealer in a major area and get a Lightning, not so much with a Cyberdumpster.
* Ford wins on interior cabin space.
* Ford wins on standard bed shape (you can use a truck box, standard camper shell bed cover, etc.).

Tesla:

* Tesla wins on fast-charging. (It literally charges faster.)
* Tesla wins on charging network (though Ford has access to lots of stations now if you get an adapter-- so not a big deal imho).

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pro & con for towing- I regularly pull a medium sized kubota tractor (with trailer) and the torque is amazing, the ride is just like a Ford (can be pro or con pending your feelings on Fords).  The pro is the fact that is makes pulling the trailer effortless with great acceleration and handling.  The con is watching the range cut in half as soon as you start driving.  For me, it is perfect since I can charge at work and have a charger at home plus the distance is usually less than 100 miles total between sites.  

Pro - can charge at Tesla Superchargers (you may have noticed that people are getting their adapters)

Con - The truck has to take up 2 spaces at the charger which can be a hassle at busy charging stops",2,,2024-09-18,0.025,0.095,0.9081
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Oh, another list.  Here goes:

Pros:

* the acceleration is actually too much power in my mind
* quiet & really nice drive
* plenty of room
* blue cruise is so nice if you drive limited access highways regularly
* I wanted heated seats but I like the ventilated seats every bit as much
* LR battery tipped the scales to a huge plus since the 240mile previous limit; only publicly charge now on trips
* F150 based so many accessories are interchangeable; do not get F150 floor fitted mats though
* Unlike most other EVs, this one is stealthy; doesn't scream EV; people only know it's an EV if they know it
* frunk size is absolutely huge
* 30A 220 outlet in bed (there's also a bunch of 110 outlets in the frunk and bed); 110 outlet in the front seat for a workspace
* cost of ownership; many describe an EV as tires, wipers and windshield washer fluid

Cons:

* charging speed is limited to 170kW; although it does charge from 20% to 80% in well less than 30 minutes
* cost; Ford is pushing the top of the tax rebate limit so many trucks are right at the $80k limit
* I wish the front and rear LED bars were more traditional (the one exception to the EV stealth pro above)
* I think everyone has issues with the auto closing frunk and/or liftgate
* dealers support; dealers make more money from selling the ICE/hybrid brothers to this truck so they don't sell them properly; dealers also don't service as many of these as the ICE/hybrid brothers so service isn't as comprehensive (I had a dealer call me when they couldn't find my truck almost a week after the first of two recalls were completed because the parts for the second recall came in; they wouldn't say they lost it but they didn't know I had picked it up; mind you, I wasn't going to take it in until all the parts were in and they blew that off)
* I don't tow but I'd be remiss to not mention the poor mileage when towing a non-aerodynamic trailer (I did pull a small utility trailer and saw no differences but it was below the tailgate)",2,,2024-09-18,0.028,0.085,0.9757

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Love my '23 XLT SR.    I have had no trouble in the nearly 7000 miles driven since June, and it's one of the best trucks I've ever owned.

That list of *past trucks* includes a 2015 F-350 King Range 7.3, a 2012 F-250 diesel 7.3, 2006 F-350 dually 6.4L diesel, 2000 Dodge 2500 5.9L diesel, and somewhere in that mix was a 2018 Chevy Silverado, a 2020 Yukon Denali, and a mid 2000's RAM 1500 with the crappy non-Hemi V8 (what a mistake) that I try to forget.

Why is the Lightning my favorite?

First of all, I no longer tow heavy -- I had the diesels to tow a relatively law RV travel trailer, and since moving out to 30 acres of woods in the country, I no longer have the desire to camp ""elsewhere"" -- so the big trucks were no longer necessary.   I sold the last diesel in the era when diesel fuel was nearly $4.30 a gallon, and while diesel gets great fuel economy for what it is -- it still cost me $100 to fill up every week just to drive my empty truck around.    In terms of fuel savings, the Lightning costs me $13 to ""fill-er up"" at home on a 48A/240V charger mounted on my pole barn, vs. $60+ to put the equivalent amount of gas into a comparably equipped gas F-150.

Second, I love the extreme power of the Lightning.   Until you drive one, *you have no idea what you're in for.*  The truck is just a hair slower than the 460 HP Mustang GT it replaced.  Sure, it won't go *as fast* due to the speed limiter, but it will the 1/4 mile done in the mid-12s and 0-60 in 4 seconds.

Third, it's quiet, refined, and useful.   Think of it as a 7500 pound 4WD Hearse.   This thing is smooth, silent, and comfortable.    Even in XLT trim with cloth seats and plastic everywhere, the build quality is second to none.    My Yukon Denali and King Ranches were nice, but they were nearly double the price.

The truck has plenty of range for my day to day needs, I charge to 90% and I get 215-220 miles with that level of charge.

Cybertruck?   I couldn't deal with the rubber-necking you'd get in one.   They're pretty cool, futuristic, capable, and fairly reliable.   They're also $40K+ more money, have a long waiting list, and look like something out Buck Rogers.

If there was anything out there I'd consider, it would be Silverado EV for the massive 200+ kWH battery and range, but then again they're $40K+ more money.  LOL.  See the theme here?

Coming from an F350, you need to ask yourself about payload an towing capacity, if you're using your truck for heavy-duty tasks.   My XLR SR has a spec'd towing rating of 5000 pounds.  The springs, hitch, and hardware itself will tow 7200 pounds, but without a brake controller and the additional cooling - I'd keep it on flat level ground and keep speeds 55 MPH or less.    My diesels would tow between 12-14K.   That's a big difference and might rule out a Lightning if you need it.",2,,2024-09-18,0.023,0.088,0.99

1. Towing for distance. I tow a pontoon boat regularly, but it's 10 miles to the lake and zero range concerns.  However, picking it up when I bought it 100 miles away was a bit of a pain.  Basically, I had to charge twice, making the trip an hour longer.

2. Long road trips. I recently did 600 miles one way, and it took a good 2 hours longer than it would have with gas. It's a 12 hour drive regularly, 14 with charging.  However, it's the first 14-hour road trip that I managed to get 10,000 steps in! (I walk when I charge).

3. Cold weather performance. I won't talk about this much as I live in the southeast US. But know that range will be a lot less driving in cold temps.

4. Offload performance. I think the tire options say it all...

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I'll be honest, I really can't think of a negative thing to say about either my Lightning Lariat or XLT. I've driven from FL to NJ in the winter, towed, loaded, camped, etc., etc. That is not to say there aren't limits or things I would change/upgrade, but I've tempered my expectations and additionally have been a lifelong Ford truck owner.

The only ""con"" I can think of to relate to your situation would possibly be towing and ONLY because you would be coming from an F-350. I am in no way saying it can't tow, just that I wouldn't probably own one if I was a frequent long-distance driver who tows heavy because of the inherent inconveniences you would probably encounter. With my standard range battery rated for 240 miles at 100%, I have towed a friend's 2023 F-150 Lariat (\~5100 lbs) and saw a range of 168 miles; the truck immediately calculates the distance as soon as the trailer or payload is on and input into the onboard tow feature and we didn't need to go that whole distance but the miles per kWh equated to the rate necessary for 168 miles, so I'd say the truck is accurately calculating.

To preface this next part, I have owned a Tesla Model 3 between my Lightning ownerships. To answer your Cybertruck question, while I do firmly believe that truck will go down as iconic based on appearance and engineering involved to design such a vehicle, I would also tell you that in comparison to the F-150 Lightning it has many stark differences. Whereas the Lightning feels like a truck by all conventional measures inside and out, the Cybertruck does not; obviously the outside but equally so on the inside and in the way the driver operates and integrates with the vehicle. I have a friend who owns a Cybertruck and truly uses it as a truck as much as one typically expects, such as hauling mulch, rocks and various other home-project related materials as well as his bass boat and jet skis. So to say it can be the truck it's intended to be (without resorting to YouTube-level extreme stunts), it can but... the polarizing design is what you have to commit to owning and answering for.",2,,2024-09-20,0.013,0.048,0.9306

The 300 mile battery on the long-range versions is a lot when it's always topped off in the morning.

It's very smooth and quiet to drive. This is really growing on me. Very nice to be in, significantly imprpves the experience of listening to music while droving. It accelerates like a sports car too, which I don't care about, but the fact that it corners surprisingly well for its size is a minor comfort perk.

The onboard power has fairly niche use-cases, but if you're in one of those niches it can be a big deal.

The frunk is a significant storage place. Not quite big enough for my table saw or miter saw, but it'll hold a toolbelt and several tool boxes, or a pretty big suitcase. It's a great place for things that are a little dirty for the cab but still need to stay out of the rain.


As for downsides, it doesn't DC fast-charge very fast even for a typical modern electric car. It'll suck a little to road-trip with (good thing it's a comfy vehicle to be in, at least), and suck a lot to haul bulky trailers with due to aerodynamic drag at highway speeds. It is also important to note that it doesn't normally get the advertised 320 mile range on the highway. It'll get more than that just trundling around town, like maybe as much as 375, but more like 280 on the highway or less if you're speeding or climbing a lot of hills.

Mine works for me. No regrets other than which charger I bought for my house. But there are use-cases for which it is prohibitively bad. Think about the tasks you do with trucks regularly and see if you'll need to fast-charge regularly. If so, maybe you don't want one, but if not, it ends up being a very capable vehicle with clear advantages over its ICE competitors IMO.",1,,2024-09-18,0.048,0.118,0.9839
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Pros: tons of things you can upgrade on the truck if you're moderately handy (I added adaptive cruise control, heated steering wheel, passive entry, securicode keypad, rain sensing wipers, and running boards to mine)
Quiet
Super quick
Nice ride
Tons of room for storage
Lots of ways to power your stuff (I power my travel trailer from my truck)
Never have to be worried about fueling up before I go to work as the battery is always topped off in the morning

Cons: towing range isn't great but it's fine for the towing I do with my boat and trailer

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I'm very impressed. It isn't gimmicky like the Hummer or CT. They really seem to have thought out the electric part of the truck well and are playing up the electric specific benefits for normal use. They're not just positioning it as an ICE replacement.

I saw some comments saying it looks just like any old boring F150, but I consider that an advantage. It's a truck. For truck people. But now it's electric. It doesn't have to look super futuristic. That will only draw people that like Teslas and trigger the people that don't like Teslas.

And all of that is ignoring the very reasonable price point.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Obviously, it’s going to have slower charging times and lack some features, but the fact that they’re offering any EV at a price that low is damn impressive considering the Hummer is over twice as much and the Rivian truck is $30K more just starting out. You’re still going to get a very usable truck for $40K though. That’s cheaper than or comparable to most other full size trucks with 4WD let alone some midsize trucks out there. It’s a good step forward to get people into that market. Still, I’m not jumping into that market just yet unless I’m forced to. I have nothing against EVs because I actually built one in college, but I like hearing noise when I step on the gas pedal too much, and I live in a rural area with one charging station. I’d be more inclined to buy an electric motorcycle like the Livewire to be honest if it wasn’t as much as a crossover SUV.",27,,2021-05-20,0.077,0.103,0.7845

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"If you live anywhere with reasonable amounts of sunshine, and install home solar panels, this truck can save you alot of money.

The solar panels can charge the truck, saving your electricity bill. 
When the truck is parked up, your house can use its battery to power appliances. Saves the electric bill again.

If you have two trucks for the household, then you might see your bill go to Almost zero. (Depending on how much Aircon you use. Aircon is crazy power hungry).

Normally the batteries you have to buy to do this cost Hella money and the playback is c. Ten years. Now you get the battery effectively free.

This could move a major portion of the US away from gas, and coal/gas power stations, and majorly cut emissions.

A car company helping the environment. Who would have thought it. 

If you've not checked it out, many states have generous tax rebates for solar. For a few thousand bucks, you could cut your electricity bill in half four every, maybe more.",5,,2021-05-20,0.037,0.096,0.9044

HOWEVER: 230/300 mile range on a truck? I understand the weight and aerodynamics are going to make it less efficient and thus require more battery storage capacity. 

That makes sense. But it's a truck... They're big vehicles. Are you going to drive one up to the mountains and camp out for a night? Not unless there's a charger nearby. 

Are we going to use it to tow things? Again not unless there's a charger nearby at the destination.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I mean, this is impressive and will sell well in certain markets. But for anyone I know who owns trucks, this definitely won't work with a 300 mile range max. Especially when towing is considered, which I assume will drop the range drastically. Even if towing only drops it to 200 miles, I know people who have cabins or places they stay that is further than that from their main homes. Or who take yearly roadtrips to Florida or Tennessee with their trucks (I live in Michigan). They take their trucks and trailers/toys/boats to the Upper Peninsula which is 200-500 miles depending on where you live in Michigan and where you are going in the UP. So people would need a 2nd truck which would go against the ideas of an eco truck for all around use.

Regardless, these are impressive numbers for a commercial truck. I am surprised they managed to get this range. There must be a lot of batteries. I also imagine by 2023 they will have a King Ranch or equivalent trim level with a slightly higher range? Maybe 350-400?",5,,2021-05-20,0.014,0.085,0.9177

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"In 2011, I was sitting next to a guy on a plane and we had just taken off from Detroit when he started talking about his pickup truck.

After about 15 minutes of him complaining about the complexity of diesel engines I asked him if he would ever consider an electric pickup truck. The tone of the conversation completely changed, and he asked me if I worked for Greenpeace. lol

He said he would never buy an electric truck because he needs the power of diesel to pull his boat. I explained to him that modern diesel trains actually use electric motors to do the pulling, the diesel engines are just generators, so electric motors are fully capable of pulling his boat.

There are potential range and other issues of course, but that aside, he still thought electric trucks were the dumbest idea he had ever heard and he basically ignored me the rest of the flight, even when I offered to tell him how to resolve the problem he was having with his diesel truck.

Now, the reason I asked him about an electric pickup was because I had just been in Detroit, consulting with one of the automakers about building an electric pickup truck.

I wish I could see the look on his face when he finds out that Ford just took 45,000 pre-orders for an electric pickup truck.",216,,2021-05-21,0.05,0.044,-0.3723

When Credit Card/Self Serve @ Pumps came out a lot of station owners took a huge hit because a lot of people just fill up and leave, less and less people come into stores to buy little things stuff.

Now is their chance to start a network and offer what people want at charge station like nice coffee shop attachments, nice restaurants etc.  A lot of them starting do that now already, just add Chargers in parking lot.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"If the choice is between CT and F150, that's one of personal choice.  But they're not fighting against each other, they're tag teaming against RAM and the Silverado.  Hell, even the F150 ICE is the opponent on this.  Each truck EV on the road is one less ICE truck on the road.

The looks are going to be a big factor.  The design of the CT is very polarizing.  Either you love it or you don't.  Big pickups, this is how they've looked for years, and truck people like that.  I know a ton of truck people.  Most of them follow the same pattern.  Buy the biggest, best, most equipped pickup they can afford, pay it off as fast as possible, mod the hell out of it, and drive it till it dies.  Rinse and repeat.

You want to get more EV's on the road, the Lightning will do that.  It will convert that person or that family that was thinking of the normal F150 or Silverado or Ram when they see everything else it can do.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"This is not surprising.   

The crash protection in an F150 was already certified.  The brakes were certified, etc.   

Making a car electric is not as hard as making a car that will pass standards.   90% of the F150 passed standards, it only has to re-certify with the new bits.   The Cybertruck has to certify the whole truck.     

Electric motors have been around a long time.  Mosfets have been around 50 years.      Sure, the batteries for this new crop of EV were lab stuff 30 years ago, but Ford simply bought the batteries, like Tesla did up until a couple years ago.  

The rate of new car manufacturers coming to market has been slowing down since 100 years ago when there were quite a few.   It slows as the regulations on cars get stricter.    If it were easy to make a new car, we'd have more new cars.      This makes me mistrustful of these new electric car makers.  They have significant hurdles way beyond being electric.   

Kudos to Tesla for being able to do it at all.   That was only done with significant investment from an eccentric billionaire who has since made his money back on the stock.       Maybe Rivian, Ride, Lucid, etc. can do it to with their huge stock valuations, but maybe they can't, like Elio, who was clever in trying to skirt the rules by making a much easier to certify motorcycle, but even they haven't gotten past making a handful of cars.",4,,2022-05-27,0.015,0.116,0.9775

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Terrible article from someone who doesn’t know much about EVs citing a single owner experience.

>The Lightning’s stated range is 230 miles (370 kilometers), 

It’s 240 miles for 2023+ models.

>but reality never seems to reflect the conditions necessary to achieve that. As soon as he starts climbing through the mountains on the 130-mile trip from Fresno to his parents’ place in Capitola, the load on the battery depletes the range until it’s down to 40 miles of power

It’s EASY to reach 240 miles of range with the Lightning if you’re not on the interstate or, *driving up a mountain* in which case, yeah. But the “40 miles of power” claim is nonsense. One, it’s not really clear when the truck says 40 miles, and two, he doesn’t *actually* only have 40 miles of range left. He probably has 40 miles of range if he keeps driving higher up the mountain past his parents’ house. But in reality, he’s going to have WAY more than that, because he’s going to be going downhill on the way back, but the truck doesn’t magically know that.

Complete nonsense, misleading garbage.

>EREVs. Those plug-in hybrids can lengthen a vehicle’s driving distance to as much as 700 miles by adding a small internal combustion engine that doesn’t drive the wheels and only acts as an onboard generator to recharge the battery.

The most famous EREV doesn’t meet this definition.

>We are looking at getting a trailer for my wife’s business and there’s just no way because that would cut the range in half,” he said. “I absolutely would never go full EV again.”

Sounds like someone who just didn’t do basically any research at all and who has a relatively uncommon use case that doesn’t work that well. He also bought the smallest battery EV truck, by far. Genius. We should totally listen to him and base an entire article around his experience.",54,,2025-02-05,0.062,0.043,-0.7544
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"> The EV market has turned as mainstream car buyers balk at high prices and spotty charging infrastructure. While the global slowdown hit every automaker, it’s left Ford Motor Co. especially vulnerable because **the company has no new EV models coming for more than two years.

And

> Ford has said it’ll reduce overall spending on EVs by at least $12 billion and shift some of those resources to money-making gas-powered models. **The company lost $35,000 on every electric vehicle it sold in the third quarter and racked up around $5 billion in losses at its EV unit in 2024.** Despite belt-tightening, the losses are expected to be similar this year. **Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates $4.8 billion in EV losses for 2025.**",61,,2025-02-05,0.089,0.03,-0.8375

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"It really just comes down to pricing. We are in the market for a new car, and we looked at the Lightning. Went back and forth with the dealership a few times but the out of door pricing was so crazy. We loved the utility aspect of the truck, and we would use it for that. And loved the idea of it being electric so for the short daily commutes it wouldn't feel terrible vs gas. 

But out of door pricing it was closer to the same cost as most luxury SUV's we were considering with it being more expensive than some of the luxury SUV's we looked at. We liked it, but not for 80k. If it was more closely priced to something like a Volvo XC90 at 60k, it'd be a no brainer for us. 

My guess is that the Cybertruck just has more fan boys who are willing to pay the extra to have it, vs a F150 is more about price and use. And if the price is too high it won't sell.",8,,2025-02-05,0.043,0.123,0.9595

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I’ve got a Lightning and it’s a great all around truck, but it also doesn’t excel in any one area. 

It’s not as fast as a Rivian or Tesla, it doesn’t offer an adjustable air suspension, software is probably a generation behind, it doesn’t have as much range as a Rivian or GM’s offerings, efficiency isn’t great, etc, etc.

What it is good at is being basically a converted F150, which is what I was looking for.

However I think most buyers are on opposite ends of a pricing spectrum here. You either have the buyer willing to spend big money ($80k+ msrp), but they want to be on the cutting edge of technology and/or show off.

Or, you have the customer who isn’t sure about EVs but is willing to try it if they think it’s reliable, simple, and will save them money. For these customers the price has to be right. They’re probably looking in the 50k msrp range. 

The Lightning is trying to find its place in the middle. 

Sales are decent and I think it should continue to be offered as an F150 trim for fleets and other buyers that want that converted F150 EV (and lower the price about $6,000.)

However, if Ford (and the legacy automakers) are really serious about this EV thing they need to take what they’ve learned and bring out a next gen EV trucks that actually smash the high end of the market and the budget end of the market.",1,,2025-02-05,0.024,0.108,0.975
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Some of this may be a pick up truck issue more than an EV issue, and unfortunately American car companies have become pick up companies.  A lot of EV owners are adopters because we don't like gas and its environmental effects they were the people who drove Priuses before EVs were widely accessible, and pick up truck owners had the exact opposite pattern.  

There are some pick up truck owners who I assume are going electric because they care about the environments but need a work truck.  But there are a lot of ICE pick up truck buyers that couldn't give AF and choose to drive their 10 MPG truck around suburbia as a single passenger vehicle.  I'm thinking a lot of them aren't going to be super attracted to EVs for a while.

>At the time of its 2021 debut, the lowest-priced version of the Lightning – the work-truck Pro trim – was about $40,000. That price was increased several times, hitting about $60,000 in March; Monday's cuts reduce the entry-level truck's sticker price to about $50,000.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I hate this new trend of announcing vehicles at superficially low prices.



Seems they always either 

-announce at a low *low* price when the release is far off into the future, so manufacturers coast for months or years on consumer & media hype about a dope vehicle at an insane price, then drop the price increase hammer at the last minute after reaping tons of free buzz & publicity. 

or

-they announce at a good price and begin selling right away but every single year the price goes up at least a grand or more until they get the price where they always actually wanted it plus almost everything is an option.

or 

-they actually do keep to their ridiculously good announced starting price but that's because they only intend on selling you a powertrain & roling shell and *literally everything* is in option or package and you *need* at least 2-3 options *and* packages to actually get the car you want and now the price has gone up *at least* 20%

then, cherry on top

-still have mark-ups, add-ons, & fees to look out for.

Paying 27% more for an electric base model EV truck ($31.5k vs. $39.9k) will still keep the attention of most who could reasonably afford the truck.  Paying $46.9k, changes that to a 49% premium, which is a fuck-off level premium for most consumers.

And the disparity gets worse for higher trim levels: 39.2k vs. 59.5k for the XLT.  49.1k vs. 74.5k for the Lariat....

>**Auto dealers are being short-sighted and greedy,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity. “They hate EVs because they make most of their money on maintenance and repairs, which EVs rarely need. So, they’d rather keep Americans addicted to oil and forfeit the EV market to the Chinese.”**

>But Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry Insights, points out that while dealers are “paranoid that they won’t get as much servicing work,” in reality “EVs will still need tires, brake pads, and work on their infotainment systems. The actual loss of revenue is not as big as people think.”

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I own no less than two Ford Mach-E’s, but I really don’t think the time is right for the Lightning for a lot of folks. Reality is that towing long distances is essentially out of the question - you’ll spend almost as much time charging as driving. If you don’t tow and primarily use it as a commuter vehicle, then it seems like you’re going to have a better time with an enclosed Rivian R1S or Kia EV9 or something like that.

It could be the perfect work truck if you don’t tow and primarily just drive around town a good amount throughout your day - it could contribute to considerable savings on gasoline and in long term reliability. And has the advantage of being able to power tools right from the plugs in the bed.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I think the price alone is my biggest takeaway. The price is very good starting out. $40k before tax incentives? Yup, not bad. Then factor in people who love the brand and want a truck, $32/$35k looks very good to those consumers. 

I’m not too concerned with the range, let’s be honest here, average folks with trucks aren’t going long distances every day and they sure aren’t hauling heavy loads around daily either. The range will be just fine. 

Big picture tho, this is a shot at Tesla point blank. Ford came with it, next up GM, then Honda,Toyota, Volkswagen ID.4 and others who are coming guns blazing. The pie is about to be cut up and I don’t think within the next 2/3 years Tesla will have those expensive prices around for much longer. The hype will die down. Seems like it already is in a sense.

Tesla is a luxury brand, and I wanna say that’s less than the 5% of people in a certain price range that buys them. You get these EV’s/Trucks around $20/$35k out the door, they’ll sell like hot cakes.",15,,2021-05-20,0.038,0.15,0.9663

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"So how much does one save on fuel a year ?

A regular F-150 gets what, 17 mpg? Someone driving 80 miles a work day , would use 5 gallons of gas a day.  Cost of fuel is maybe $2.75 post pandemic?  So that's $13.75 of fuel cost a day for someone that has a solid commute. 

How many kwh will someone use for 80 mile commute day in just announced vehicle?  50 khw per day?

So in some states, incremental electricity is what? $0.20/khw? ball park? (I know its higher in north east states like NY / CT).  So this person that uses 50 kwh a day would pay $10.00.

So someone would say $3.75 a day in fuel ($13.75 - $10.00); x 300 working days = $1,125 a year, before considering casual driving on weekends?

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"So as usual this thread is filled with redditards claiming guys who use trucks for work won't buy electric because they are ""progressive"". 

I'm a guy who owns multiple trucks for work. 

First problem is the fucking thing has four doors and a tiny bed, and that will probably be the only configuration available for a while. That sucks. 

Second problem is we tend to keep our trucks for a long time. What happens when this thing breaks and it's out of warranty? Who is going to be able to work on it? Will replacement parts be readily available at reasonable prices? This is important, because Ford (and GM and Dodge) all have big quality issues:

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Sounds like to a large extent they’ve got their suppliers to eat the cost, and that’s in a very old tradition going back to the earliest days of the Ford motor company.

Suppliers to Henry Ford were given strict instructions on the shape, size and materials to be used for the packaging in which their components should be delivered to his factory. Ford then broke up the boxes and pallets they were sending him to use as panels and floorboards for the cars he was building.",50,,2021-07-16,0.031,0.028,-0.0772

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Is there any definite list of Lightning prices? There was this “leaked” document a month ago, but it looked kinda fake. 

Cool features like the home charging, ventilated seats, and big 15” screen only came in the Lariat trim and above (Lariat 2nd most expensive), and from that rumored price sheet, it would cost above $60k before the $7k extended range battery. 

Some speculated there was trickery in the “300 mi EV truck under $40k” line where a stripped down fleet version cost $40k, while you needed to get a trim at a min of $50k before adding in the $7k 300 mi battery. 

A fairly premium gas F150 Lariat costs maybe $59k, and I feel the EV version being nearly $70k is a huge jump, even for an EV. Lower trims only have cloth seats… $55k+ for a low range EV with cloth seats? Even Tesla is a better value if this is the case.",10,,2021-07-16,0.067,0.1,0.6987

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I went to a dealer and tried to check them out about a year ago.

I saw them on the lot and asked for someone who knew about the pickups.   Once I had a sales guy there, I specifically asked about the Lightning.

The sales guy looked annoyed and tried to tell me details on the new Ecoboost engine.

I told him I was certain what I was looking for and he shrugged and said ""I don't know a thing about those, wait here"".

I sat for about 10 minutes before going up to the sales desk to ask what's going on.  I told them someone had gone to find info on the Lightning and he looked confused.  Said ""some of the sales guys have gone home for the day"".

I'm guessing the guy I talked to lazily told someone to deal with it and then left for the day (it was early evening).

Regardless, I found someone to talk to me and he took me out the trucks.  I asked him about range and he quoted the extended range miles, but he was pointing at standard range trucks.  I asked him if these had that range and he said ""yep"".  I looked at the window sticker and pointed out the different number.  He shrugged and said ""oh ok, I guess maybe these are the older model"".

At that point, I told him I'd look around and let him know if I needed anything and just resorted to reading window stickers.

I didn't see any more sales people before I left.

That's how the dealers feel about these things, I guess.

I felt like I'd have to grab one by the ear to actually buy one.  WTF.",215,,2024-10-22,0.033,0.03,-0.4018

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"F-150 Lightening was such a terrible idea. There are a few types of buyers:

* People who legitimately need it for work
* People who buy one for cultural reasons (fitting in with their local community, displaying a certain persona, etc.) This is the largest segment of buyers, as most half ton buyers do not actually use the functionality of the truck and simply drive it as a passenger vehicle.
* Weekend warriors: People who may need to tow their boat twice a year or occasionally do home improvement (even though the math works out the just paying someone else to deliver / tow those few times a year + buying a more economical vehicle is usually the better option)  


The traditional F-150 doesn't share a lot of overlap with current EV shoppers. Ford should be focusing on passenger vehicles and saving an electric F-150 for further down the line when EV's become more ubiquitous (and hopefully less politically polarizing)",1,,2024-01-19,0.029,0.063,0.6919

They all drag their feet to start EV production and then when Teslas start taking market share they go all in and start large amounts of spending to completely change their operation.

Meanwhile GM cancels one the more popular EVs that aren't a Tesla and has a loyal customer case just as their sales are showing year over year growth. Then they are surprised people are upset and announce the Bolt is coming back.

Then they allow a strike to go on costing them significant amounts of money only to give up ground. Concessions which were fairly obviously going to be given up because from the onset almost no one outside of  themselves sided with their point of view. 

Then they announce rolling back the EV plans because they don't think the market is growing fast enough.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"This post's headline is very misleading. If you read the Electrek article you will see that actually Ford F-150 Lightning sales are abysmal. It took them 12 months to add an additional 2200 units per month to their production volume.

Ford F-150 Lightning Sales:October 2023:           3712 unitsNovember 2023:      4400 unitsMonth over month increase:  688 unitsThis is 18.5% growth from October 2023 to November 2023.  Good to see some growth, but its a trivial amount due to the low volume they are generating.  Ford's initial plans were to be producing 12,500 units per month by now, but they recently announced they are scaling way back to focus on gas/electric hybrids, which are even more expensive to build and maintain.

November 2022:     2200 unitsNovember 2023:     4400 unitsThis is an increase of 2200 units from the prior year November sales. This is a ""doubling"", but it took them 12 months to get this meager monthly volume increase of just 2200 units more per month!.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I really like my lightning, 6000 miles in and here are my not so favorite things about it. Other then these things it's an amazing vehicle, so quiet and smooth and powerful and handy with the frunk, bed, and 2nd row area

1. It's a massive vehicle and I came from a Chevy Tahoe. Turning radius is like tell zip codes, getting into parking spots isn't easy

2. It's not very efficient compared to other EV's, but then again there isn't many land yacht EVs like this. In the winter it takes more finesse to do road trips, I'm seeing a range down to 150-160 miles even when I limit cabin temp and fan speed

3. Suspension is way too soft which is nice for on road but even then sometimes it feels bouncy. Off road it becomes a problem

4. Towing a camping trailer on standard range is 90 miles if you want to risk getting to 10% soc. It's manageable but if you're towing once a month or more, longer than 180 miles one way than I don't recommend this truck. I figure 180 miles one way is manageable as you'll do only 1 stop but other than that it's cumbersome. We only camp maybe 5 times per year so this seems like an acceptable trade off for being a great commuter. The trips greater them 90 miles one way we stop an ea at a Walmart and get groceries while it's charging so it's not much of an inconvenience stopping",1,,2023-12-03,0.086,0.12,0.8919

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"“In its fourth month, the Cybertruck had over a thousand registrations and outsold the R1T by more than two to one,” said Tom Libby, associate director of industry analysis at S&P Global Mobility.

Huh? What kind of industry analyst is he?

Four months in, and they’re still only making about 1,000 per month? That doesn’t look like a ramp-up at all. When they did their pedal recall in April, almost 4,000 CTs were affected. So they sold 4,000 in five months, and 1,000 of those were in their fourth month, March. The numbers are flat, if not going down. 

If they really plan on making 250,000 of them per year, they’d need to make over 20,000 per month. While laying off people. 

And that target is ludicrous, because the CT is pretty much exclusively a US market vehicle. So they’re planning on outselling the Toyota Tacoma with this break-down prone monstrosity. 🤦‍♂️",1,,2024-05-17,0.025,0.039,0.4836

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Recently test drove a Platinum and despite the hate here it is objectively a nice truck. It doesn’t look like some Cyberpunk 2077 off-shoot with warped body lines, it has a good amount of technology but not a tiresome amount, it’s insanely quiet in the cab, very comfortable, and it has an insane amount of get-up. 

Biggest problem with these is the dealers don’t want to sell them and they are overpriced as a result too. We’re 2 months away from 2025 and I recently saw a lightly used 2023 Lightning Platinum still selling for 67K that was used as the managers truck. 

Ford dealers hate this thing because there is zero money to be made from service. By most accounts the issues with them are primarily software-based and thus they can’t milk the consumer further as useless middle-men. 

The Lariat trims have absurd pricing(65-80K) and many cabin features + options are locked away to the Platinum trim. For example, the leather seats in the Lariat are straight up taken from taxi cabs in the 2000s with their black and gray color scheme. You pay nearly 70K for this thing and it looks like it has school bus seats. 

The Platinum new is between $80K-$90K, there are poor if any lease incentives and it is not eligible for the $7500 credit as well. It just doesn’t make sense, for $80-$90K you could get a Raptor, TRX, RHO or a fully loaded(Platinum, KR, Limited, Tungsten, Denali Ultimate/High Country) HD diesel. Not to mention the Silverado/RAM REV/Sierra EV which all have much better numbers and are stand-alone platforms that are purpose-built for this. 

I think these are going to be an even bigger flop moving forward without major improvements and Ford strong-arming dealers to sell them. It was a good move at the beginning but Ford dropped the ball and now competition has caught up.

The RAMCharger in particular looks like it’s posed to take the lead in ICE-alternative trucks in my opinion.",126,,2024-10-31,0.08,0.102,0.6569

AND add in interest from an above average rate from my above average credit score, I’m in the hole for 100k over the life of the car, whose maintenance best practices (and cost) is wholly unknown.

Who’s the market for this?

I mean “technically” I could afford it with a car loan. But I already have a paid off car, how does a 100k luxury expense when I could use that money for a non-depreciating asset or necessities make any fucking sense?

If I’m going to drop 6 figures on a car, it’s going to be on a restored 69 Mach 1 mustang. Not some battery powered toy whose place in the market is to be thrown away after 5 years.

  
Some of Y'all reading weird shit into my comment. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings if you bought an F150 lighting or want to buy one. A 69 mustang is just as dumb of a financial purchase. My whole point is that it's overpriced. If you can come up with why it \*IS\* worth the money an average consumer will buy it at, I'll take your word for it.",18,,2024-10-31,0.079,0.093,0.6291

Industry wide the full-sized truck market sales are decreasing. The vehicles are too large for many but more importantly the higher interest rates are decreasing demand. Industry trends are 10-15% off MSRP for full sized trucks right now.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,">The F-150 Lightning is an incredibly important EV for Ford. In Fact, Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, and Executive Chair, Bill Ford, compared the pickup to the 21st-century Model T. It was heralded as the gateway for Ford's EV transition, though adoption has proven slower than anticipated. In fact, the automaker has already scaled back production targets to half of what was originally expected for 2024 and slashed two-thirds of the workforce at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center where the Lightning is assembled.

>Another slap in the face has come directly from Tesla. The F-150 Lightning, despite sales being up 86%, lost its title of best-selling EV pickup to the Cybertruck and the F-Series pickup as a whole is at risk of losing its 42-year crown as best-selling vehicle in America to the Tesla Model Y. Granted, those Cybertruck sales have largely been the fulfillment of years of orders, so it will be several months before we see if it has long-term juice or not. 

>According to data from Cox Automotive cited by Automotive News, Ford has a 100-day supply of F-150s on-hand at the end of September. Generally, dealers want cars on lots for 30-60 days at most.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"The Lightning needs a refresh because the things that make an electric car great is outdated or undersized. 

I love my F150 Hybrid, that was my gateway to the Lightning. After a month with the Lightning, I felt the range was lacking. I didn't expect to get to the stated range, but I got way worse especially when I only charged to 80-85%. While my Model Y usually come in about 40 or so miles under the stated range, my Lightning came in almost 100 miles under the stated range. I got about 120ish miles on an between 10-80% charge (I found myself at a Charging Station a lot for a quick charge at the end of the day). It's enough but it doesn't leave my with enough buffer at times, but the overall range made it hard to do any light road trips on the weekends.

Also I see a lot of folks talking about them producing the overpriced model, and while I agree to some extent, their Platinum Lighting sucks. They had that ugly ass grayish blue for the longest time, and now they have this white/black combo. I felt like it the interior was a massive downgrade compared to the hybrid I was coming from and I accepted that it would be inferior when upgrading. 

I wanted to like the Lightning, but on paper and all the reviews I'm reading about the Sierra EV is basically what I want in a Lighting. If they can give me a regular F150 Platinum interior with roughly 400 miles of stated range so I can bump the usable range closer to 225 miles daily and have a truck that I can take to Tahoe or Yosemite without having to charge both ways. I'd consider getting it again. But it desperately needs a refresh, I wanted to like it because it's the only EV truck that's a traditional design so I can convert it to a work truck if I had to. But the overall experience is that a Rivian R1T is much nicer (but bed size and utility doesn't suit my needs), The Sierra means I can't plop a traditional lumber rack on it when I need. The Cybertruck is just a pass.

The Lightning legitimately could be good, and that's worst than just being a bad product. Range and interior quality and design is what kills it because you can get a gas/hybrid F150 and if we're comparing the Platinum (before they downgraded that and introduced the Platinum Plus) between the gas and the EV, the gasser was much nicer in every way even though they were suppose to be the same.",10,,2024-10-31,0.085,0.07,-0.9096

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I’m hopeful they take this pause to fix their model year situation. They have been way off on the F series platforms since the chip shortage. I took delivery of my 2022 F350 in February of 2023. I then bought a 2023 Lightning in August of 2023 and six months later they were still building 2023’s. 

The 2024’s have only been out for a few months as most automakers are already producing 2025’s. Your new car lot looks weird when it seems like you’re always selling last years model. 

And as for sales… The Silverado and Cybertruck are now readily available and in the case of the Silverado… possibly a better product. Ford needs to do a 9-10% price cut and make the sticker more aligned with what folks are actually paying. 

For example most on the Lightning subreddit are paying mid 60’s for a Lariat ER, the sticker is $80-82K and scares people off. An equivalent ICE lariat is $75K before rebates so the Lightning is very competitive in house and in general pickups have gotten very expensive. F series sales are down 4% this year.",7,,2024-10-31,0.041,0.054,0.5413

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I put a launch day deposit down on a Lariat at what I believe was the $60k price point.  When it was delivered to the dealership, the sticker was $92k with zero incentives.  It was supposed to be a 2022 model at launch pricing, but they made nearly none of those and then jacked up the price on the 2023 models although I was previously told by the dealership I'd still be able to get the launch pricing.  I subsequently refused delivery, and then the sales manager accused me of ""vanity ordering"" with the intention of not taking delivery - probably because I showed up in my old grubby around the house work clothes instead of something more dressy.  Then they sold it for over $100k because it was one of the first Lightnings on the lot.  I vowed to never set foot in that dealership again.

Now the Silverado is here, and it's in every way a better vehicle.  Designed from day one as an EV, with no gas vehicle carryover platform compromises.  492 miles on the Silverado with the max range battery compared to 300 on the F-150.  That's an ass-whooping, son.

Ford needs a complete ground-up redesign and put a realistic sticker price on it, like yesterday.  I don't feel one bit sorry for them.  They did this to themselves by luring customers in with bullshit vaporware pricing at the beginning of all this, with full intentions of not building many 2022 models before jacking us all with 2023 pricing.",5,,2024-11-01,0.064,0.032,-0.8248

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Shows the importance of presidential election.  Unless government stays the course on EV adoption in the US, US automakers will take a huge hit in profitability and competitiveness vs. China, the leader in sustainable transportation development.  China's government supports its auto industry while US auto makers get whipsawed by industrial policy.

What would help US mfgs who have invested in the future is increased EV credit for buyers.  Even credits to mfgs for production of EV's.

To the F150 specifically, average F150 is $60k so it is an expensive vehicle to start with but the market is mostly anti-EV white males (86%) so F150 EV's are selling against the pickup truck market demographic.

F150EV will be a small portion of the pickup market and is made even smaller by the higher cost for EV vs. ICE version.  Nice Ford makes them but it is to be expected to have a limited market especially this early in EV adoption.",3,,2024-10-31,0.014,0.103,0.875

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Having done several uneventful 1000+ mile trips in a Lightning (and not the long range version from the article), the article illustrates the 3 main outcomes of EV trips, right now:

1) The first half of the author’s trip: If you entrust your trip planning to the Lightning’s navigation and the Electrify America app alone? Good luck. You’re going to take a stupid route, with unnecessary stops at slow chargers, or even worse, be routed to chargers that are offline. 

2) The second half of the author’s trip: If you take responsibility for planning the route and use apps like PlugShare, where other drivers post reviews of charging stations, being flexible even en route to make changes to the plan, you’re probably going to have a good trip. Like I said, I’ve done four 1,000+ mile trips in mine in the last year, including a 1,400 mile trip starting in 15*F weather in Iowa.

EA is incompetent and Ford’s nav software is downright bad.

Everyone will be in MUCH better shape when they have access to Tesla Superchargers this spring, as noted by the 98 Superchargers that were at the site of the article’s charging debacle, which leads to outcome #3.

3.  As someone who has also done several long trips in a Tesla, it doesn’t have to be this way. I’d head out on a long trip in a Tesla with nothing but the built-in Nav telling me what to do and not worry at all.

For all Tesla/Musk’s faults, their usability on trips is on a different planet from most other EVs.",12,,2023-12-23,0.06,0.057,-0.2122
Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Wife and I drove her phev 75 miles away to some outlet malls yesterday for some last minute Christmas shopping,  got there and battery was about dead.  Drove around for almost 30 minutes looking for the charge stations because the location on the map was wrong for the first 2 we tried.   

Finally found them,  mall had 4-5 free ones, all full with a line of people waiting to use them. Found some non-free Go chargers with an empty spot.  Downloaded the app, about 5 minutes of registering and adding payment info, only to get asked the cars VIN (why??!?), which it said it didn't recognize. Several minutes struggling with that and realized there is a way to skip that part and finally ready to charge, so we thought.   Then we had to identify the charger, there was a label on it, but that label didn't show up in the app search, finally we noticed there was an asset ID shown on the status screen,  finally we found the charger in the app!   Tried to activate charging,  charger throws an error.   

I got in the car and said screw it, we don't have to plug in to get home, we've got a half tank of gas, and moved the car to a regular parking spot.  And after shopping that's exactly what we did, we drove home in Sport mode, and between going down the pseudo mountain and a decent amount of traffic resulting in a lot of regen, we got home with 78% charge.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Ford's order banks are open for the 2024 model year Lightnings, so Ford is offering discounts clear any remaining 2023 trucks off of dealer lots.  Dealers may of course set any selling price they want, but most will honor Ford's discounts.  This is a normal end-of-model-year process for traditional US carmakers. 

We didn't see this last year because: the 2022 and 2023 Lightnings are practically identical aside from chip-related feature deletions; so few 2022 Lightnings were produced; and demand for the Lightning was strong enough that very few 2022s were sitting on dealer lots when the 2023 trucks started shipping.

There are some noticeable changes for the 2024 Lightnings:

* All 2024 Lightnings have a heat pump for better cold-weather range.
* Battery size is now based on trim level:
   * Pro and XLT trucks are now standard-range (98kWh) battery; and 
   * Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trucks are extended-range (131kWh) battery.
* Flash is a new trim level that effectively replaces an extended-range XLT truck; there is nothing comparable to a standard-range Lariat in the 2024 line-up.
* BlueCruise is now a 90-day trial followed by a subscription.
* Changes to Level 2 charging for extended-range trucks:
   * Maximum Level 2 charge acceptance rate is 11.5kW via a single on-board charger (down from 19.2kW from dual on-board chargers in the 2022-2023 trucks).
   * Ford Charge Station Pro is no longer included with purchase.
* While all 2024 Lightnings will initially use NMC batteries, at some point later in the model year, the standard-range trucks will switch to an LFP chemistry.  There probably won't be any cost or range differences when that happens.",12,,2023-10-12,0.016,0.082,0.9651

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I don’t get all the dealership bitching. I’ve bought two Fords in the last two years and the first one took 350 days to show up, they had me locked at my negotiated price and I saved $5000 under the current sticker. Nine months later I traded that truck in at a different dealer and got $4500 over KBB, carvana, and previous dealer offer, And $3000 in rebates from Ford and the EV tax credit coming. So $10500 off sticker, and a $4500 trade in credit. $15K total. Now Ford laying $15K on the hood. Its a no brainer. 

There were several dealers in my area playing the markup the past few years and I avoided them. Good dealers are still around or order from one out of state. 

Also note with the Lightning the delivery charge is not rolled in to the price, their are lots of nicely equipped Lariats like mine that are priced $80001-81995 that still meet the $80K msrp rule.",1,,2023-10-12,0.037,0.101,0.886

From watching reviews, it seems like there's nothing wrong with the Lightning for people that don't do distance towing, but it's probably too expensive for what you get.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"It's no coincidence that this is happening just as CT is about to ship.  Also playing into this decision is the build up of Lightning inventory at dealers. 

Funny how Jim Farley said that Ford wasn't going to compete with Tesla on price.  CT hasn't even started shipping yet and Ford is cutting prices.   I thought that Jim said Ford was going to offer superior value to customers such that they wouldn't have to compete on price ?

Also funny that the biggest cut ($ amount, percentage) is on the base model and not the premium models.  Just goes to show how much Ford is gouging on their high end offerings. 

Also funny is how Ford criticized Tesla when they cut prices, like prices of vehicles are never supposed to go down.   And now Ford is cutting prices, again.  We are living in a new world.",4,,2023-07-17,0.073,0.115,0.8402

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,I put the reservation down a few years ago when they touted $39k for base model.  I always expected it to be higher with inflation and production changes. I figured maybe +$10k.  But +$20k if you could even get the base. The only option they were filling were for Lariat and were arriving at dealerships at $100k.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I traded my Rivian R1T for a  '23 Lighting Lariat ER last month. Ended up getting it for nearly 20K below MSRP.  For a full sized pickup with 320 miles EPA, it was a pretty great price imo, especially when you look at the pricing of full-sized ice/hybrid pickups.  So far I love the truck. Interior comfort and extra space makes it a better road tripper and just a generally more comfortable truck to drive.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"I check up on the used F150 Lightning market from time to time to see if the EV doom & gloom has depressed it enough to spark my interest and what's weird is that all the ones for sale are always super low miles, like a few hundred to a few thousand miles for a 2023 and only a few more miles for a 2022. Nobody is trading in their 10~15k mile/year trucks... I guess those people like them.

It is mind boggling when you start figuring what these truck's original owners paid to hardly drive the thing for a year or two. Don't forget to figure in insurance and maybe a 240v charger install too but that's probably a rounding error compared to the depreciation, especially if they bought it at the peak of dealer markups. The cost/mile is, at the risk of repeating myself, mind boggling.

People are weird. Like, if you're barely going to drive the thing, then the fuel and maintenance savings of an EV hardly matter but I guess that's just my pragmatic side talking. I guess some people just have to have the shiniest new thing and are willing to set money alight to have it and then again to move on to the next shiny thing.",3,,2024-04-22,0.081,0.068,-0.4778

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"As someone who works at a Ford dealer and has some inside knowledge, let me tell you, we are not even quite there yet on who gets their Lightning. The reservation conversions to orders will be coming in 'waves'. You will be notified directly by Ford if you are selected for the first wave. The dealer will then be able to see who has been selected to convert to an order once the notifications from Ford have gone to the reservation holders. There is no guarantee you're even getting one. I was 2nd in line (by 19 seconds) at my dealership in the reservation queue. If you have  under 50 reservations, the dealer gets to 'prioritize' 5 people. 51-100 is 10 priorities. We're at 49 due to a few cancellations, but I'm luckily one of those people. From the verbage of the release to us by Ford, even being prioritized might not guarantee someone is an owner in the first year. All reservations not selected will of course be able to hold their reservations to the next model year.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"They didn't even bother to use it as a truck. Here is a video of the truck pulling a empty toy hauler, and was getting less than 1 mile to 1% battery life. They only made it 86 miles with 9% left. That means every hour & a half. You then have to stop and charge for longer than you drove to get it back to 100% battery. So on a day with a temp of 80* f, and a empty trailer they got to go 86 miles. Just think if the weather is super hot, or cold. The battery life will suffer. So your range will be reduced. Then add another 2,000lbs in weight once you load you sxs, and normal gear. So again you would get even less road time.. Game changer. Hell no unless you are talking about how it's now going to take a full day to go 400 miles. Like I have said before. It's good at everything but being a truck. Hard pass.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"[**Paywall dodge here.**](https://archive.ph/26HUJ)

>*According to a planning memo obtained by Automotive News, Ford has told suppliers to prepare for average volume of around 1,600 Lightnings a week at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Mich., starting in January. It assembles an average of 3,200 a week today.*

That would be an annual run-rate of *approximately* 75k, for anyone out there doing the napkin math. Not terrible, but not great considering Ford had [just finished a facilities upgrade](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/08/01/ford-restarts-expanded-rouge-electric-vehicle-center--f-150-ligh.html) meant to allow them to hit that original 150k mark.

""Each of those four episodes was followed by a serious recession,"" he said. ""The current monetary contraction is clearly going to lead to precisely what monetary contractions always lead to: a recession.""

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"It looks quite awesome but it's too expensive for its target market. People looking to pay that much are going to want more, probably in terms of both size and range.

They should have made a smaller cheaper simpler light duty electric pickup with decent range. That would sell like crazy among people who really need a truck for work and want to escape the high cost of gas, and for fleet vehicles. But US auto makers seem dead set against selling affordable smaller cars. They want to sell giant overpriced chonkers. I bet the margin is higher.

I think what they really fear with smaller cheaper EVs is cars that require virtually no maintenance, last forever, are cheap to operate, and are low margin. That's what customers want but it's deadly to their profits.

I think that’s the issue here, even if they promise, they can *still* change the terms last second. Is there anything legally requiring them to keep their word, even if you do get it in writing?

I think that’s what’s so off putting about the whole dealership model. They can make any promise they want, then change it last second and face virtually no repercussions as long as there’s someone else to take your place.

Now that our Bolt battery replacement appears to be imminent, we called to cancel the pre-order, and they're giving us our $500 back later this week. They never tried to jack up the price on us while we had the order in place.

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"Koons has a pretty crappy reputation.  My own personal experience involved the purchase of a used Mazda CX-5 that they advertised as having the full tech package.  So I priced it out based on that and decided “yup that’s a good deal.”  Bought the car, and on the drive home realized when it got dark that it didn’t have the upgraded headlamps, that the cruise control did not have the radar distance function, noticed that the mirrors were not auto-dimming, etc.

Got home and called them and said “hey, you sold me a different car than advertised.  I’ll return the car or we can renegotiate the price.”  They refused to renegotiate and at first they stood their ground on all sales being final.

Fortunately, I’m an attorney. And I’m very familiar with deceptive trade practice laws in most states.  Not only would they have had to take the car back, but they would have owed me additional compensation, attorneys fees, civil penalties, plus any fines that the VA gov agency would have wanted to tack on.

I got escalated up to the GM and he finally caved.  Took car back for full refund (as if it never happened).

Comment,Ford F-150 Lightning,"About 20 years ago I was trying to buy a Mustang.  It was not a hot market.  And I was looking for about $3000 off.  Koons was the only dealership I went to that said MSRP or nothing.  And it was just weird.  They implied I could not get what I wanted elsewhere and they could sell everything they had at MSRP.  The lot was FULL of Mustangs!  So I  went to several other dealers and they all offered $2000 off straight away.  I ended up getting my price, which basically was wholesale.  The dealer profit at that point was holdback/bonuses they get.  But the attitude from the salesperson at Koons was nothing short of amazing.  Rude.  Laughing at my request.  Even taunting.

“Get rid of cars!” they say.

The Riviain just feels more well built and premium. The automatic frunk is really a game changer too. The Tesla charging network is obviously a big plus for Tesla (although I can use my Rivian at most). The autopilot is also eons better in the Tesla and I'm actually surprised at how poor it is on my Rivian (my wife's Toyota's is actually better).

Comment,Rivian R1T,"To preface. The last 5 years, I've owned 4 Teslas -- Model 3 SR+, M3 LR, MYP, MYP. I'll be brief, I believe they are good products and I made this decision because I believe it now stands for the wrong thing. Hope my Tesla goes to someone else instead of them buying new. Better to act on your convictions than to not act at all.

I considered the Ioniq 5, EV9, F150 Lightning, Polestar 3, Mach E, Mercedes EQS.

I was looking for something similar to Tesla. I mainly wanted the regen and software to be similar. And from a Tesla owners perspective, the Rivian is very similar, which is great! The regen is even stronger and adjustable.

Some of the other EVs DEFAULT to no regen or low regen. And they never remember your regen settings when you get in, you have to hit the paddles every time! I'm looking at you Kia and Hyundai!

I was not a fan of the software for the F150, Mach E or Mercedes. The layout of the Rivian infotainment is akin to modern tablet OS and has a native spotify app like Tesla. I can even google cast to it, which could arguably be easier than the native youtube app on Tesla. I can cast crunchyroll animes!

And to close this out. It's faster, SOFTER suspension, more versatile, and more luxurious inside. We are very happy with the swap!",46,,2025-03-17,0.051,0.104,0.935

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Looks lovely! My lease on Lucid Air is going out in a few months and I am researching SUV alternatives with a 300mi+ range. I am a little pumped right now for F150 Lighting for balance of price, space, and range. We have test driven R1T, loved mostly everything in 1st row (software, space, comfort) but didn't like the rear seat comfort (space and ride on auto suspension). Have yet to TD F150.

What is the reason you chose R1T over F150? I am curious to know what your analysis was before actually made the decision. Also, did you consider BMW iX?",3,,2025-03-17,0.024,0.12,0.8685

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Definitely pull the trigger, 2022 owner here, best vehicle I've ever driven.

1. They should be fine.  While I personally have the 20"" on my R1T, I have the Pirelli AS on my MDX (21"" equivalent tire), and they are very capable on plowed roads, just be sure to carry appropriate snow traction chains/cables/socks.
2. R1T drives great.  Good turn radius, easy to park with the 360 birds eye cameras.  Surprisingly nimble for a vehicle this large, though it is smaller and significantly easier to park than a full size truck.  Worst case may have to back into spots more.  Coming from sedans it will be a learning curve, but you'll love the overall feel and visibility from the R1T
3. I also have two kids and a beagle.  Car seats and booster seats work perfect in the back seat.  Perfect vehicle for family of 4, though would be tight with 5.  I do however recommend getting steps or rock sliders, made getting into the vehicle signiifcantly easier for everyone (even when in LOW suspension).
4. Driver+ is great for what it is on Gen 1: Freeway adaptive cruise (even in stop and go) with automatic lane centering & steering.  It's almost hands-free freeway driving.  Adaptive cruise works on city streets, but not lane centering.
5. if you're buying used, I would just make sure there is still 2 years and 20k miles left on the warranty, this way if the original owner didn't fix any issues, the warranty will cover it.  Getting a service center appointment can be a pain, but Rivian will generally take care of any issues no problem and no cost while under warranty.

Edit: Also, with kids that small, don't be afraid to put some corner guards on the gear tunnel door.  Depending on how early VIN you get, the edges on early VIN gear tunnel doors could be sharp.  I ended up putting some edge protectors on mine, which also saved my shins and knees as well.",16,,2025-02-12,0.045,0.176,0.9936
Comment,Rivian R1T,"Hi, in the Bay as well. 

There are a couple of things to get used to but if you are coming from a Model 3 you’ll be fine. 

It’s a great adventuring truck. 

The family of 4 will fit fine, it’s a fantastic tourer. Lots of storage space in the R1T, especially with the gear tunnel.

It’s big but not huge, turning radius and overall size are the biggest things to get used to coming from a smaller car. 

Snow mode is a game changer for Tahoe.

I would say to get 22 wheels, good range, great performance and lot of options. 21 is very limited in tire size and 20 would be good if you lived in Tahoe/the country.",3,,2025-02-12,0.035,0.249,0.9876
Comment,Rivian R1T,"I bought 2022 LE as used a year ago

  
1. I drove my R1T to Tahoe area last weekend, it did fine, I didn't do any snow driving but my tire is M/S rated with 4WD, so I don't even need a chain or snow tire which is good. but I don't have experience with 21"" wheel. look for tire options before buy it

2. I live in Newark/Fremont area, I don't have issue parking, since Berkeley is bit older area may be it has issue, but I am sure people drive full size pick up around Berkeley so I think it wouldn't be a major issue

3. don't have kids

4. it is not great especially compare to autopilot or FSD. but it does fine while on highway driving, sometimes I have to put manual inputs, but stress is way less

5. I have trouble with alignment, got it aligned 3 times from Rivian SC from 2 different locations, and still having issue, test drive it and check if it is off by too much and ask seller if willing to get it aligned before sell it",3,,2025-02-12,0.058,0.051,-0.5091

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I wouldn't buy an R1T to drive around the Bay Area as a primary vehicle, esp if you're coming from a Model 3. I just went from a Model Y to an R1S myself. I have a tire carrier mounted on the back so it's as long as an R1T. Parking these big vehicles is tough.

Rivian has a fantastic camera setup, but that can't get past the sheer size of the vehicles.

I visit the Bay Area frequently, parking in SF and Oakland can be a nightmare. You won't fit in some garages. Around Berkeley can be a little tricky too.

You will find yourself searching for pull-through spots in the back of parking lots, unable to fit in parallel parking spots, etc.

Maybe rent an EV truck for a weekend and see how it goes? I think Rivian also sometimes offers overnight test drives. You may just be able to go visit a mall parking lot or try to parallel park on a regular test drive.",1,,2025-02-12,0.031,0.032,0.2902

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Just a thought.  In addition a to the CV joint suggestion to explore, the “clicking” sound may be the suspension doing minor air pressure adjustments which is normal.

We can all agree the service center experience can be improved.",6,,2023-11-05,0.028,0.176,0.8878
Comment,Rivian R1T,"Rivian definitely need to fix the charging issue. My breaker had never tripped while charging for over the pass five plus year with a different electric car but had done so 4-5 times with the r1s. My max rating for the mobile charger is 16amp, but I had to dial it down to 10amp for it to avoid tripping. Now then I use the faster charger we just install, same thing, 48amp is max but I have to use 40. The Rivian app doesn’t warn you about the vehicle stopped charging, which is a disappointment. When I moved from the faster charger to the slower one, the vehicle doesn’t adjust and of course trip the breaker again.

For the clicking noise at slow speed, it is suppose to be normal because that’s the air suspension adjusting.

Best of luck getting your issues resolved and it’s sad you have to go through them. I have an hood alignment issue due to get service on December 8th. It’s at a very just service center so I don’t know if I should even bring it in or just ride it out until more centers are open. Hearing stories about damages to cars or cars sitting there without getting services is not reassuring. For now try to focus off the positives. It’s an amazing truck!

Comment,Rivian R1T,"The charger issue could your home electrical wiring or the settings in the charger itself. If your wiring is not up to spec it you will have to much resistance due to the gauge size of wires in the house and the charger will turn off. It’s possible you need to lower your app rating in the truck (there is a setting in the charger screen) for now until you figure out the issue. If you lower the amps in the truck setting and it works then it’s very possible the house wiring. If it’s the house there is no need to wait till Jan 29th. 
Trying this will at least give you some confidence by the time the appointment comes around. 

If your door, window, light doesn’t work that’s probably one single plug going to that door. Very annoying for sure. 

The carpet I have no idea, I have an R1T and I can’t think of a location where I could get underneath

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Well if the CFO is right they should be on spot to be at gross profit, not profitable by Q4. TBH after having one for 2 years, if mine was totaled today I would be ordering a new one with the insurance payout same day. With over 75,000 vehicles out on American roads and a fully operational manufacturing plant, I think bankruptcy is pretty far from the next thing for Rivian.. Amazon Owning 2 billion of the company would likely mean a potential influx of cash if they need 2 more quarters to get R2 out. TESLA for example had 10 billion in debt and 2 billion in cash in 2017.

Today Rivian has 4.4 billion in debt and 9.8 billion in cash. The next steps when they run out of cash is not bankruptcy it would be to enter into debt portfolios leveraged by their companies assets to keep afloat until R2. That 4.4 billion in debt is the Georgia plant though so that will be a net asset at completion, the 9.8 also excludes the 1.5 billion raised in Q4 of last year. So they are really at 11.3 billion.... A much better place then even Tesla was 6 years ago.

So in short I think if the sweet kiss of death comes I have 3 more years until it does. And even then they will have 200k+ vehicles on the road and a portfolio of assets that likely mean they get gobbled up not dissolved. Could be wrong.


The news is always bad if you arent comparing it to the other data points available. Is Rivian profitable no. Is Rivian as safe a bet as a Ford or a VW. No. Is Rivian likely to go bankrupt in 2024... No.

Also remember GM and Chrysler/Dodge already went bankrupt in the last 15 years bankruptcy also doesn't mean you disappear it likely in this case means restructuring.

Right now most analysts have Rivian as a neutral.
Also I'm interested to see how this att pilot goes, they are buying an untold number of R1's and EDVs


What would suck but be a ways off is if they went like SaaB and were peacemealed by their parent company until there was none left. But they make vehicles people want and love, something SAAB at the last few years had an issue with...",68,,2024-03-02,0.061,0.081,0.7415
Comment,Rivian R1T,"In addition to building a good vehicle, Rivian has built a lot of brand equity.  They are the most likely to repurchase brand according to Consumer Reports.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Funny, im actually considering taking a big long-term buy on Rivian stock. The sentiment right now is very low, but we expect them to launch the R2 sometime early next year with a price range in the 40s-50s, and to further drive down the cost to build cars by 35% by Q4 with retooling in their current plant. Amazon also ordered another 100,000 EVs, and they’ve re-did their contract with Amazon which allows them to sell to other commercial fleets. They’re in talks with new ones now, and think they’ll start seeing orders in 2025.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Anyone with common sense should be extremely concerned about spending a hundred grand on a Rivian vehicle now. The world is different than when Tesla went through this stage. Rivian is facing unique challenges and there’s a significant probability this company will fail. The share price is reflecting this risk, and millions of investors are selling their positions. I suppose another company might step in if they fail, but this isn’t a sure thing. Imagine no software updates, no warranty, impossible to find parts, closed service centres…in 3 years. What will the resale be then? Who do you turn to if the vehicle is bricked when one of their “in house” components fails? Even if they aren’t bankrupt in 3 years, the depreciation on an R1 purchased today will be horrendous. EV technology (batteries, computers, sensors) is improving so rapidly. I eagerly ordered an R1S Launch Edition in 2019, and only this month am I scheduled to take delivery. Waited 5 years, only to receive a vehicle that is scheduled for a refresh in a couple months. The design and hardware are 5 years old. Up till now, they’ve been delivering all those pre-orders to people like me, who ordered at reduced prices. I’m not even sure it’s smart to take delivery at the old, lower price. I really wonder how many people are buying Rivians at current prices. Clearly there’s a demand problem for R1, which is why they aren’t ramping up production in 2024. Their factory has capacity to build 4 times as many. I’ll probably cancel my Launch Edition order. Would’ve been cool to receive it 2-3 years ago, but it isn’t feeling so cool, or smart, in 2024.",-3,,2024-03-02,0.116,0.12,-0.1059

Anything above 2kWh is additional range that will help me get home.

Currently when I camp off grid, I use on average 1-2% battery per day, so this will be a super useful option for that.  Over a week I lose almost 10-15% battery.  A product like this eliminates that loss and adds back, meaning I can go deeper in the country and still confidently get back.  

It’s almost like an electric Jerry can for off grid camping and overlanding.

Obviously not for regular charging, but common folks, stop hating the solar solution when so many of us with actual use cases will buy these!

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I pushed my deal through quickly as well. Little different scenario as I picked a '24 out of the store as they were coming available for the $6k F&F discount. clicked ""buy"" on Thursday morning. Took Delivery Monday evening. Fastest and easiest transaction for a vehicle in my 27+yrs of driving. Even with the hiccups along the way.

No real document errors, but lots of back and forth on the trade in ('17 Q7) to get my existing bank to get details sorted. Then a lot of back and forth to get the agreements signed. Several ""little"" errors like yours, namely a couple of inputs like address and zip code that were clearly ""fat fingered"" or had digits reversed. You could tell the people putting the paperwork together were rushed. Also got the ""If you don't sign the agreement today you'll lose your discounts"" text message with nothing remaining to sign. Got the email with my agreement about 2hrs later, and signed it within minutes. 

Delivery wasn't quite as great. I left my garage door opener and house keys in my trade. Rivian team overnighted them back to me (I was 3.5hrs from delivery site), so that was awesome. Didn't get to ""test drive"" the truck before signing papers. Kind of wish I would have as I now have a service appointment for next week to address suspension clunking issue and a significant vibration around 50mph. 

Overall though, still has to be one of the easiest vehicle purchases I've ever made. Didn't have to do the stupid ""song and dance"" BS with a salesperson and a finance manager and all that crap that comes with the dealership experience of other brands. My initial test drive was in Toronto, and there was ZERO finance talk during that visit, just a dude at the service center that was genuinely enthused about the trucks and was there to show us around. Same with the delivery day, that guy (Chris in Cleveland) was just happy to be there and to answer questions. Customer service has been great this week, and every interaction I've had with a Rivian employee has been positive, even when working through issues or problems (albeit minor at this point). 

I'm enthused to be part of the brand, and if they keep this up, will become a brand ambassador in no time.",2,,2024-10-04,0.07,0.129,0.9828

Comment,Rivian R1T,I too love these WHEN they work.  I’ve had at least 4 occurrences in a short timeframe where the dash just tells me they aren’t available.  Sometimes they come back on next start.  Once I had to soft reset to restore.   Love them when they work but really hope Rivian triples down on software quality this year.  Too many bugs being introduced IMO.,83,,2025-01-02,0.0,0.158,0.8776

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I picked up my R1S in December- the very first time I drove at night was on a winding mountain road in a hazy snowstorm, so I saw a pronounced version of this video for my first time with headlines (which was wild, haha).

That said- I still feel like I'm blinding people. I have had a few cars flash their brights at me- that said, I'm not sure if that's their *own* auto-highbeams turning on after almost passing me, or if it's a ""hey asshole, turn your shit down"". I'm also curious if the normal LEDs of the Rivian are just like... bright, in general.

Have any of you tested this on the other side of things? Does getting hit by adaptive headlights annoy you? Am I just overstressing about all of this? Since the first night I've basically manually turned adaptive off and on out of that fear (which kind of defeats the purpose of adaptive headlights, ha!)",3,,2025-01-02,0.08,0.086,-0.3584

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Great news!  Since this is possible it means other up and coming companies like the Chinese EVs can copy this process and make battery packs even cheaper.  Perhaps by 2035 a 100kwh battery pack will be like $1000.  This would basically turn the majority of cars into freeway legal golf carts.  They could be dirt cheap.  


Perhaps the better analogy would be plasma TVs.  You use to have to buy them from specialty Electronics stores and they would cost as much as Cars back then.  Maybe in the future a freeway legal car might be as cheap as buying a TV from Walmart.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"> So how did Rivian achieve this without slapping on a set of super-sticky cheater summer tires? We think it most likely has to do with the amount of regenerative braking capacity afforded by having four electric motors. Each motor essentially turns into a generator under deceleration, converting much of the Rivian's speed back into electricity. Not only does this help efficiency, it also takes a load off the mechanical brakes so you're not overworking them.

If they're relying on regenerative braking, does this mean it's under-braked like some other EVs?",2,,2021-11-10,0.035,0.086,0.6105

Comment,Rivian R1T,"And yet I have trouble caring...

Every time I hear about how a new electric vehicle is the fastest ever I feel like we're celebrating that water is wet.

We get it, electric is great. Low centre of gravity, lots of torque and if you load them to the gills with batteries they go far and can go fast.

Ignoring the weight and price (which is both almost double that of your average vehicle), charging infrastructure is almost never addressed. It's the ugly side of electric vehicles that people don't want to talk about. 

People that can afford $75k trucks will often have driveways or garages to park and charge their vehicles overnight, but many don't have an option to charge at home. With not that many EVs on the road, charging at a supermarket is a valid option for those people now, but that will stop when every other car is electric and they all need to be charged by the handful of chargers at the mall.

A lot of effort is being put into charging cars faster but that doesn't change anything if there's still only a limited amount of electricity being provided by the grid. I'm not talking about the grid being able to generate enough electricity. I'm talking about the wires getting the electricity from the plant to the cars.

Unless I've missed news about significant upgrades being planned to that part of the transition to a full EV future, EVs will become like solar panels, in that they further improve the financial benefit of owning property, but do little for those that aren't able to.",0,,2021-11-10,0.064,0.075,0.7498

Refer to page 16 to understand what they face here. These improvements will bring the revenue and cost of goods closer together and hopefully turn it into a positive result. However merely being positive is not enough. Rivian still needs to generate sufficient revenue to run the place and that is represented by the two lines, Research and Development followed by SG&A.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I think the big 3 still will come out with the best option here at some point.  Tesla has the price right but that design is one only a mother (or father in this case) could love.  Rivian has the looks/features right but the price is up there.  

Obviously pickups get up to $80k when you buy the most expensive one but I’d say most are only willing to stretch their 84 month payment plans to a $50k truck.      

Maybe the hope is that people who have money and want practicality but are turned off by the fuel waste of pickups will move to Rivian?  I love it and feel like I’m one of those people but seeing the Cybertruck pricing makes me rethink the value of Rivian.

Edit: lots of wise ass comments about the big 3.  Ford/GM/Ram who own the majority of pickup market in the largest pickup market in the world.  Let’s calm down with the chance to shit on these companies for their overall performance for a minute.",307,,2019-12-25,0.064,0.171,0.9686

The key takeaway for me here is the longevity this allows for you to keep your vehicle.  We all know battery degrades over time.  By not allowing you to fully charge to its capacity, you can lengthen ownership of the car.  Instead of battery degradation that would require you to replace your car after x number of years, maybe you replace in x times 2 years.",2,,2025-03-03,0.063,0.063,-0.25

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Well, before jumping on the bash Rivian bandwagon, let's look at this from their perspective. I understand if you're dragging around the extra weight of a portion of the battery you can't use, you might find it frustrating, but consider this....   
  
Rivian's cost of purchasing, inventorying and scheduling the assembly line for multiple battery sizes would cost Rivian more per unit (the golden rule => higher volume = lower cost). Rivian chose a single standard size, larger battery, and passed the savings along to those that didn't want the up-front additional cost. When they offer a purchase option for that extra capacity - at a reasonable price - it seems like everyone should be happy. 

You don't have to buy the extra capacity. But your vehicle just went up in value. The purchase option will add to the resale value - offering the next owner the option to purchase that extra capacity - if they ever want it.

I bought the Dual Std, so I don't have the same dilemma. But the worst case  scenario would have been if Rivian did not offer the customer the option to purchase that extra capacity / range, right?",1,,2025-03-04,0.064,0.081,0.5743

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Seeing people rationalize this is wild. Please stop being part of the problem. Rivian isn't giving anyone a deal. All this proves is that the vehicles aren't worth as much as they are selling to customers that wanted the larger capacities. They wanted to sell more vehicles but knew that they needed a lower price point so they had a software lock engineered for it and schemed that people will pay a ""small fee"" to sully unlock it later, while paying a lesser amount upfront. Really, more cost goes into the vehicles with the software lock due to the software engineering needed to develop this ""feature"".
It's sad that companies are resorting to this to exploit their customers. This is on par with Mercedes and BMW having subscription services to unlock features that are already built into your car.

Would be nice if the article mentions how much more range you get.   It currently says the locked vehicles get 330 miles and the unlocked ones get 329?  

I *think* if you bought a large pack before a certain time, you actually got a max pack that was software locked. 

In which case, those trucks are better than what you paid for even if you don't pay to unlock the extra range, because charging to 100% is probably only charging to 80%, and the pack should age very gracefully.",29,,2025-03-03,0.028,0.167,0.9589

Comment,Rivian R1T,"The whole ""off-road"" aspect seems superficial for this truck, especially with the air compressor that it has. You can't really air down on 20"" wheels, *especially* on something that weighs 6000 lbs. 

[Watch](https://youtu.be/391AsASvmi8?t=704) what happens when people who really ought to know better try to go through a moderate trail with 20"" wheels. Ford has bead-lock wheels from the factory.  I feel like they're marketing this for city people that want to feel like they *could* go off road, but really never will. I think Rivian would help themselves if they called this a great car camping truck instead, which is what it is.

It's also hard to know swallow paying $70k for a ""truck"" with a 4.5' bed (is there a truck with a smaller bed?), no Android Auto/CarPlay, no overhead cameras, for a manufacturer's first car, with who knows what kind of service coverage. I'll wait for the Lightning Raptor :)

Yeah, the odds are against Rivian, and any new EV company that isn't Tesla.

The cybertruck is something completely different and is not going to complete with any truck buyers.

There is a historical proof of this if you look back to the orginal honda Ridgeline which at the time on paper was a great midsize truck and beat others by a long shot. It had a weird look and some odd things. They found out quickly very little overlap.  Hence why the new ridgeline looks like a fing truck.

The R1T does not really even directly complete with the F150 as it is mid size truck vs a full size.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"$82k to $99,400 for my R1S.  

I’m out.  

That’s an 18% price jump in 3 months, with no guarantee that when my build slot theoretically comes in 2023 that the cost wouldn’t jump another $20k. 

At $82k, you could make an argument that it wasn’t *that *much more than a nicely equipped nice 7-seater. 

It’s easy to get a Suburban into the high-$70s.  A GLS starts at $77k.  

But at $100k, you’ve got some wild competition.  Like, two brand new Land Rover Defenders.

Hope some other manufacturers come out with electric 7-seater options that aren’t stupid expensive.",153,,2022-03-02,0.07,0.131,0.6967
Comment,Rivian R1T,These guys just totally fucked their first customer base hard. The least they could have done was keep pre order customers happy and retain their original price point. Jacking up a 75k car to 100k on someone who has to wait two years or more for it is a slap in the face. I had high hopes for this company now I'm not so sure,536,,2022-03-01,0.111,0.135,0.2104

Comment,Rivian R1T,"Preordered Jan. 2019 to help support a local company (live 50ish miles from Bloomington-Normal).  Just canceled my R1S order.  We did the 1st Mile experience last year and found the vehicle a lot smaller and not as refined as we had expected, but thought price was fair and we planned on paying and taking delivery.  Understand marketplace has changed, but a 20-30% price increase at one swipe (if truly valid) was poorly managed.    

Horrible consumer experience for all the folks who have preordered and waited. IMO wouldn't be surprised if there is another price increase before deliveries happen.  I suspect they think people thought more of their vehicle than they think of it.  They will have a lot more competition in the next year or two as more BEV's are released.

For those sticking with the price increase, enjoy seeing your delivery date make a HUGE jump forward OR maybe it won't change in case Rivian decides on another price jump due to changes in market conditions.",46,,2022-03-02,0.05,0.144,0.9528
Comment,Rivian R1T,"i know exactly why they are doing this (inflation, supply chain, too much demand), but it doesn't help the sting of waiting 2-3 years, passing on other EVs, wanting to support a new company, only to find that they won't honor their pricing. this will cut down their backlog significantly, and boost profits near term, but in almost all other aspects this is a failure. Mainly of communication, which is unfortunately no surprise to anyone who follows the company. I think we all knew the pricing was too good to be true. And I think we probably would've been okay with some graduated pricing increases or loss of certain options, in exchange for some benefits like maybe free membership /subscriber benfits for a year or two or something. But the way this was done abruptly, and all at once, reads like poor management and leadership.

Personally, I think execs are sitting in the boardroom looking at their bleeding valuation, supply chain issues, with the competition coming hard and fast, and they are not comfortable with the situation, so probably a while ago they said ""axe some features, cut costs, raise prices, because we need to stay afloat, and we'll do damage control later."" Basically survival mode. I'm guessing they shopped around for more opportunities for big investment and came up dry. they want to build another factory and they need cash, its that simple. I think they could have found a better way though. and unfortunately, Rivian now has a definite pattern of not communicating with customers. In fact it appears that Rivian never once considered pre-order holders to be customers at all, despite taking their money and not paying any interest on it. 

I predict they will back-pedal a bit. not because they magically achieve higher rates of production, but just the optics. their employees are all over this sub and the forums. as soon as they see the fall out, we'll get a friendly email from RJ, like usual.",13,,2022-03-02,0.117,0.142,0.9196

Comment,Rivian R1T,"From motorlinks: 

""Last fall the company abruptly terminated Laura Schwab, who was lured away from Aston Martin to head Rivian’s sales and marketing.

Schwab, in a lawsuit against the company, said one reason she was fired is because she questioned Rivian’s pricing. The R1T electric truck’s starting sticker price of $67,500 was too low, Schwab said in her suit. Rivian was on the cusp of launching its IPO and had already booked thousands of orders for its pickup.

Her suit says: “First, it was clear that the vehicles were underpriced, and each sale would result in a loss the company. Ms. Schwab ultimately contacted Dennis Lucey, Rivian’s Finance Director, and worked with him to develop pr1ojections showing how much of a loss the company would incur if Rivian did not raise prices. Ms. Schwab raised this issue with several executives, including Mr. Behl, Stuart Dixon (Director of Product Management), and Andy Zicheck (Principal Product Manager).

“Mr. Behl brushed her off. Eventually, Mr. Hunt raised the issue with Mr. Behl, at which point Mr. Behl agreed that they would need to raise the vehicle prices after the IPO.”",1,,2022-03-02,0.069,0.024,-0.7845
Comment,Rivian R1T,"So did everyone else get the email from Rivian reversing course on this today?

“
Hello Everyone,

Earlier this week, we announced pricing increases that broke the trust we have worked to build with you. Since originally setting our pricing structure, and most especially in recent months, a lot has changed. The costs of the components and materials that go into building our vehicles have risen considerably. Everything from semiconductors to sheet metal to seats has become more expensive and with this we have seen average new vehicle pricing across the U.S. rise more than 30% since 2018. Given our build lead up times, we need to plan production costs not only for today, but also for the future.

As we worked to update pricing to reflect these cost increases, we wrongly decided to make these changes apply to all future deliveries, including pre-existing configured preorders. We failed to appreciate how you viewed your configuration as price locked, and we wrongly assumed the announced Dual-Motor and Standard battery pack would provide configurations that would deliver price points similar to your original configuration. While this was the logic, it was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian.

We also didn’t manage communications well. We didn’t give you enough insight into what was driving these decisions. The most important aspect of what we are building is our relationship with all of you. As we demonstrated earlier this week, trust is hard to build and easy to break. In speaking with many of you over the last two days, I fully realize and acknowledge how upset many of you felt. I have made a lot of mistakes since starting Rivian more than 12 years ago, but this one has been the most painful. I am truly sorry and committed to rebuilding your trust.

One of the things we talk about a lot internally is that we will make mistakes – it’s part of building something complex. The key is to learn from them and address them when they are made. It is how we grow. We made a mistake in how we approached our pricing changes, and what is important now is that we fix it.

For anyone with a Rivian preorder as of the March 1 pricing announcement, your original configured price will be honored. If you canceled your preorder on or after March 1 and would like to reinstate it, we will restore your original configuration, pricing and delivery timing. Our team will be sending an email in the next few days with more details.

Regarding our updated pricing for future preorders, the introduction of our Dual-Motor configuration and Standard battery pack has been designed to enable us to maintain lower starting prices while adjusting the pricing of the Quad-Motor and larger battery packs to reflect rising costs. Building a durable business is core to the continued impact we can deliver as a company. We are focused on building a brand and products that will continue to scale to different vehicle sizes, use cases, price points and markets – this growth will only be possible with your support and continued feedback.

Thank you for the personal notes and discussions I had with so many of you. Your feedback makes us better.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"The process sounds a lot like buying new with Rivian, and it's backwards. You should be able to inspect and drive the vehicle before buying it. As consumers, we are giving up a right when we don't do that, and then pay for it later in repairs and service visits. This also rewards the company for not delivering perfect trucks from the factory.  

I don't regret buying my truck, but had I heard the noisy suspension before buying it I likely would not have bought it. They replaced the front shocks and line supports, but the suspension is still not as quiet as my base f150 was.",9,,2025-02-24,0.074,0.089,0.1943

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I love Kyle and everything he’s done for the EV community. I appreciate how he calls it like it is. For me personally, I don’t road trip a lot and using level 2 charging has been perfectly fine for my needs. The ADAS is a big downside compared to other manufacturers. And the audio system definitely needed quite a bit of EQ adjustment for me to get it right for my preference. 

That said, he did try to add some positives at the end that I think need to be highlighted. The R1T balances its size, storage, and overall driving performance better than almost any vehicle on the road, regardless of EV or ICE. This is a lifestyle vehicle, so there are some compromises to be made but at the end of the day, Rivian does a lot right and it’s still my favorite vehicle I’ve ever owned.

We are in the EV infancy stage and the pace of innovation will be blazing fast, so Rivian does need to make sure it keeps up with all of the new vehicles that have come out since R1 platform was released. Is his critiques warranted? Absolutely. Rivians balance sheet is in a tough spot with having to drastically cut costs while balancing quality. Seems like the pendulum may have swung a bit too far towards cost savings with Gen2 in some areas.",47,,2024-11-24,0.022,0.113,0.9628
Comment,Rivian R1T,"I rarely DCFC my gen1 r1t but yes, it's not good at thermal control and only holds 210kw for 10ish minutes. They're adding manual pre-conditioning which will help a little bit.

Lane assist also isn't great compared to like GM blue cruise or BMW. Hopefully it'll get better.

Rivian needs a few key things on Gen 3 R1 for me to upgrade from gen1:


800-1,000v architecture.

Porsche level thermal management.

50a 240v outlet in the bed.

20a 120v outlets in the bed instead of 15a.

Hopefully they’ve got some software magic somewhere and are holding back some charging performance to be conservative. His nitpicks about the gen 2 sound system being awful compared to the early Meridian in gen 1 are also fair for anyone who has listened to both.

Comment,Rivian R1T,"When are we going to just admit that when it comes to road trips that span over 8 hours one way, the EV of today are not as time-efficient as traditional fuel cars, especially in challenging weather and road conditions? 

It takes around 1.5 hours per 8 hours of driving to charge most EV vs. about 10 minutes for traditional fuel cars. It shouldn’t even be a debate. 

If you’re a very frequent 8+ hour road tripping person, an EV may not be the best choice just yet, even a Tesla which has a great charging curve and thermals management. 

But for people whose main use is local daily commutes (and occasional road trips) and have access to cheap chargers, however, EV is just a great way to get around! 

I have test driven the Model X and the R1S G2 (two competing EV), and Rivian truly shines bright given it still retains the basic safety features absent in Tesla (BSM, RCTA, parking sensors, surround 360 camera), the seating comfort, and the overall build quality. Their UI is also coming along nicely and gear guard etc. useful gimmicks are now competing closely with Tesla. The Tesla chargers are also open to Rivian, and it’s only a matter of time before they replace their onboard charging port with NACS. So even that’s a wash. 

The only two redeeming qualities Tesla has today are charging curve / thermals (that Kyle complained about in the Rivian), and well, full self driving, for those who care (it’s indeed a feat of engineering IMHO). But otherwise, it’s Rivian’s game to lose now.",1,,2024-11-25,0.031,0.138,0.9855

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I like Kyle and his long-ass reviews.  They have filled many a weekend afternoon whilst doing chores around the house.  My wife walks in and sees him on screen and rolls her eyes with a ""hello Kyle"" remark.  I haven't watched this one yet, but normally I wouldn't care much about fast charging speed, except I'm rapidly approaching a use-case scenario where this becomes more important to me.  We have a kid in travel soccer and our eTron is essentially useless on trips past 200 miles because (a) the range sucks, and (b) Electrify America is a shit show.  We've gotten around this by either taking my Model S (not ideal because the kid alone has like 3-4 bags on these trips) or the kid's Tiguan.  Now that she's committed to playing soccer in college, we are looking at a roughly 320 mile one-way drive to see her home games.  On what is about a 5-hour drive, I don't want charging to take a minute longer than it has to.  If charging is going to add another hour to that drive, we're on a plane vs. being able to drive and bring stuff with us for the kid, or potentially work on an investment property if we decide to buy something near her school. Interesting strategies by manufacturers.  An Audi senior years ago all but admitted that they don't care about range.  They think it's overrated as a concern for buyers and apparently saw nothing wrong charging $90k for an eTron that can barely get 200 miles on a cold afternoon.  That might be one of the reasons why reports are suggesting they've suspending production of the Q8 eTron.  Rivian seems to care about range, but not so much your ability to charge the car quickly.

Nothing can be ignored.

That's not to say that getting to production *isn't* hard, but it's not a race.

Being closer to a full size truck will still make it unwieldy in some scenarios, but competition is good and maybe the Cybertruck will push Rivian to implement similar features (locking diffs, faster charging, more outlets, bidirectional charging).

I will wait to make my decision till TFL or Car throttle get it and we get to see less rose colored reviews.

Still sticking with the Rivian for awhile though.
My reasons, CT is closer to M3 in interior... Not a good thing.
CT Cyberbeast is 99k and what I would need to get to replace the Rivian, I got my Rivian pre price hike at 78k. And could replace it today for 86. 13k is a lot.

The only thing I would like more of in my Rivian is the back seat room, the CT and Rivian look to have comparable back seat space after seeing MKBHD side by side in them.

Steer-by-wire - Amazing, allows for infinitely configurable steering, everyone will go down this path, hope Rivian is one of the first to follow.

48V - Rivian should do it too ASAP.

Cross car wiring - Amazing advancement. Normally cars have wires going from front to back and side to side, a wire for each electrical component from cameras to speakers. Tesla will just have one Ethernet cable (like your network cable at home) to transfer data across the car.

The batteries - One of the reviews showed how the launches were so consistent, it seems like they don’t overheat. If you follow out of spec, it seems like Rivian keeps overheating towing long distances; if Tesla doesn’t, that’s a massive bonus.

What is your opinion on the launch vs a ‘23 model (I’m interested in the R1T) Also what do you think of dual vs quad motor? Don’t really want a quad but for the price I might if some think it is worth it.,3,,2025-01-25,0.0,0.097,0.5418

Comment,Rivian R1T,Can we stop talking about fucking Elon. It’s not a statement. Talk about Rivian. Talk about how excited you are. The height of your sentiment is to “stick it” to a multi billionaire who doesn’t know you exist?

Thomas Edison revolutionized four industries; electrical, telecom, motion pictures, music.

Elon Musk revolutionized five so far; Electric vehicles, private space exploration, renewable energy (Solar City), distributed telecommunication (Starlink), and online payments (PayPal). If Hyperloop/Boring Company and Neuralink ever get traction, we'll be looking at more.

I'll be interested to see how this holds up long-term. These vehicles *were* designed to go offroad, were designed to handle deep water, but the duration and depth of exposure is significant. I do think it's a testament to build quality but I don't think this truck is out of the (proverbial) water yet.

I've been quite impressed with both the build quality and overall design of my truck. For example, there are multiple seals for the doors, double seals on the windows etc. These were advertised as offroad capable vehicles and several owners have pushed them pretty far with impressive results. Big question will be high how the water came up and for how long.",86,,2024-10-03,0.012,0.15,0.9643

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I have an R1T after owning multiple Raptors and TRXs. The Rivian is my favorite of all of them. I didn’t need the hulking size of today’s 1500s and the proportions of the Rivian are just right for me. I do what most suburban dudes do with trucks: haul furniture, garbage from the lake house, lawn crap, and occasionally tow my boat or seadoo no more than 40 miles. It does all of this incredibly well while being a much more fun and pleasant place to be than inside a dour Tesla (had a M3P and Plaid in the past). 

I have a Cyber beast already on order, but the novelty already is wearing thin and I’m not impressed with the range of the CT at all. I have the mall terrain 22s on my truck and it has no problem maintaining 2.3-2.5 mi/kWh on the highway with a real world range of 300 miles. Unless I see some major improvements, I’m not getting rid of my Rivian that I got for 72.5 after the tax credit in 22 for a 120k toy.",2,,2024-03-21,0.034,0.091,0.8812

Comment,Rivian R1T,"From an off-road and on road perspective, the R1T seems to have the Cybertruck beat (until we hear otherwise about the Cybertruck’s off-road capabilities). The R1T also seems more functional with features like cross bars on the roof or bed, built-in air compressor, and storage pass-through. I’ve also seen the R1T in person and that interior is solid - they paid so much attention to fit and finish which we know Tesla doesn’t do well. Assuming there are no major issues with the car, Rivian is going to sell a lot of these. No one will sell as many as Ford though, that much I’m sure of

The Cyber has the wow factor tho and definitely looks bigger. Plus the charging network and Autopilot/FSD. I’d still prefer the Cybertruck for those reasons and glad I made the tri-motor reservation.",10,,2021-09-29,0.029,0.133,0.9337

Comment,Rivian R1T,"I'm not a truck guy, but it looks like Rivian did a great job here. Lots of attention to detail, and it seems obvious they did a lot of testing with people who really use trucks a lot to provide the sort of features they want. 

It's full of stuff that would make truck fans go ""oooh that's nice!"" and that's exactly what electric vehicles need, especially pickup trucks.

The harder part, I think, is scaling up to a few hundred thousand deliveries a year, with good quality. That's manufacturing, sure, but it's service and support and repair centers and a whole mess of things besides. I hope they nail it!",6,,2021-09-29,0.024,0.215,0.979

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"This is not a good thing.

That means the center of gravity is high enough to allow a strong enough rotation torque on the truck to bring the front wheels off the ground. 

It also means the center of gravity is high enough to where the truck will be easy to roll. 

One of the advantages of evs is the skateboard design that puts the center of gravity really low between the wheels. It's nearly impossible to roll a Tesla. With the Hummer, the battery pack is so big, it is double stacked. Bringing the center of gravity up. That's on top of the ground clearance. I wonder if the battery pack is high enough where it can roll. That's kind of dangerous on a 9000lb truck that can do 0-60 in 3ish seconds.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"As a ""if I had to get an American car, it'd be a Ford"" guy, I'll be honest in saying I have a fondness for GM recently.

If the hummer pans out, I think I'd absolutely trust GM over Ford for EVs. Ford's EV portfolio is a mess, and doesn't give me confidence that they actually have a product or plan. Shared stuff with Rivian, shared stuff with VW, Ford's battery supplier penalized for some sort of IP infringement. Unless Ford announces something real big, or the rivian products are crazy good, I don't have any confidence in Ford to pull off an EV portfolio as big as it's planning. The Mach E does help, though.

I'm so intrigued by the ""new"" GM. I'm not used to seeing them make....not-crappy vehicles. So we'll see. I'm optimistic. Definitely rooting for them.",79,,2021-04-06,0.083,0.156,0.9021

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"Nice work by GM, they have impressive EV tech. No doubt they will have strong EV offerings to come. I grew up in a GM family and root for them. 

Now, I am curious about EV impact on cars in general though. What happens to cars like Civic SI, Elantra N line, Golf GTI, Veloster/Elantra N, Corolla, Camaro, Mustang, Challenger, Charger, BRZ/86, Golf R, and the rest of that segment in the 20-50K range that offer manual transmissions, good overall range, and lightweight sporty/sports cars(with some exceptions)? Do automakers want to kill these cars soon or will they fight for them to remain ICE? 

If these cars go EV, how heavy will they be and get they offer similar value or will they get much more costly? Like if Honda Civic SI went EV, I don't see it how they can make it fun with pure EV powertrain, cost 26K, have solid range, and be lightweight. 

So far, we have seen Camaro might be killed off, rumors of Camaro-like EV, Mustang due to go full EV but with suv offering and now supposed sedan offerring on the way. Mustang coupe may die off? Challenger/Charger living on until 2024 with ICE. No news on what comes after that.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"For perspective that's a little over twice what my Leaf uses. Presumably the Hummer is a lot heavier, so to me it makes sense. Anyway I don't think the arithmetic is even accurate. 

886kwh/month = 30kwh/day not 24. The Hummer used about 80% of what an average houses uses in a day.

TBH the comparison with a house seems to me like either anti-EV or anti-Hummer rhetoric. Numbers in a vacuum + trigger bait description. Let's see how a gasoline engine stacks up. A wimply li'l Honda Civic has a 180 horsepower engine. This is equivalent to 135kw (1hp = 750w). Driving it 50 miles at 55mph takes a little over an hour, so is that 135 kwh, or more than 4x what a house uses in a day? I'm not an engineer but I suspect this simple conversion isn't valid - the car probably only exerts 180hp at full throttle or I dunno, going uphill with a heavy load maybe.

GM/Ford made a lot of efforts over the last 20 years to change the ‘average vehicle to Trucks/SUV/CUVs.  They struggled through years of shit-tastic crossovers while killing off sedans/wagons to turn everyone mind to buying CUV/SUVs. (I’m not saying their sedans were that much better)

To calculate the energy content in 5 gallons of gasoline, we need to know the energy content per gallon of gasoline and then convert it to both British thermal units (BTU) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).

1. **Energy Content of Gasoline:** A gallon of gasoline typically contains about 114,000 BTU of energy. 

2. **Energy in 5 Gallons of Gasoline in BTU:** To find the total energy content in BTUs, we multiply the energy per gallon by 5:
   \[ 114,000 \text{ BTU/gallon} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = 570,000 \text{ BTU} \]

3. **Converting BTU to kWh:** To convert BTUs to kWh, we use the conversion factor where 1 kWh is equivalent to 3,412 BTU. So, the energy in kWh for 5 gallons of gasoline is:
   \[ \frac{570,000 \text{ BTU}}{3,412 \text{ BTU/kWh}} \approx 167 \text{ kWh} \]

Therefore, 5 gallons of gasoline contain approximately 570,000 BTU or about 167 kWh of energy. This calculation provides a rough estimate, as the actual energy content can vary slightly based on the specific formulation of the gasoline.",1,,2023-12-09,0.0,0.117,0.9545

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"Even a current model Corolla (which we consider on the ""lower end"" of cars) the LED headlamps are about $1,000USD each. At the time of repair, I was able to get the customer a ""good deal"" on a used one with broken tabs for about $780. These automotive lighting prices are out of control. To me, technology should share an equal sign with progress - and the fact that lamps are doubling, quadrupling, etc. in price is the complete opposite of progress. Yes, LED's are a little more efficient and offer a little better lighting, but when a headlamp costs $1,000USD+ on a 2022 Corolla whereas they were about $200USD in 2002, you can keep your efficiency and power and I'll keep my cheap halogens.",9,,2022-10-13,0.027,0.12,0.8594

Despite being a software defect, GM actually replaced the lamp assemblies entirely and acknowledged that the affected software was embedded in the taillight's microcontrollers.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"Idk about you guys but I'm horrified of these new EV SUVs. The last thing we need is the average driver having access to a 10,000 lb, lifted monster accelerating 0-60 in 3 seconds. The amount of damage that momentum would do even at 35-40 miles per hour is horrifying.  Imagine that thing rear-ending an average compact sedan with nothing in the back to protect you...

I don't feel like responding to every comment individually so in short I will say this:

1. The destructive force of a skateboard designed EV hitting your car at speed X is not the same as that of an ICE car of the same weight, going at the same speed because the weight distribution is not the same.

2. Tesla sedans are not as concerning as a Hummer SUV that is heavier, does not handle as well, and rides higher up. Loss of control in an SUV is probably much easier than in a sedan.

3. Tesla's safety claims have long been scrutinized in the industry and by statisticians. There are even people that calculate fatality rates in Teslas are much higher than comparative ICE cars. I haven't looked into this, nor do I know the website/author, but judge for yourself: https://medium.com/@MidwesternHedgi/teslas-driver-fatality-rate-is-more-than-triple-that-of-luxury-cars-and-likely-even-higher-433670ddde17",65,,2020-01-30,0.144,0.045,-0.9778

I still dont understand why they would chose to do this - in my eyes, Hummers were the opposite of ecological (huge engine, powerful gas guzzlers) but I think at this time, resurrecting the Hummer brand will be much better from a company perspective than creating a completely new, weak ""eco"" sub brand",2,,2020-01-30,0.067,0.116,0.4372

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"I know I'm gonna get hated for this, but I love it.

My least favorite car ever was the Hummer h2 & h3, because it was just an awful vehicle in every way, that sacrificed every functional aspect and cool factor from the h1, which was literally just a humvee for the road, for cheap GM plastic chrome and styling that announces to everyone how much of a jackass you are. If a car is going to look big and crazy, it should be able to back it up. This is the first hummer in 15 years that isn't just a massive douche yacht, it actually has real off-road capability, speed, cool features, etc.

I don't care if a car is 'unnecessary' if it's in a cool, impressive way.

I've seen 2 hummer evs so far and each time it's brought a big-ass smile to my face because it's just so crazy. Yeah, there are probably gonna be some idiots who buy one and never use it other than flexing, but at least with this hummer they could back it up if they needed to. The previous 2 models were owned exclusively by dickbags because they were needlessly excessive, but not good in any way. The only reason you bought  hummer h2/h3 was because you wanted people to notice you, even if anyone who knew anything knew that it was a massive piece of shit and nobody respected you. In this, people will notice you, but they won't immediately think you're an asshole, because the ev is actually cool.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"If anyone is thinking they're gonna start working on an electric troop transport for combat environments that's not why they'd be looking into it. The Army would most likely be looking at options for a standard home station electric utility vehicle for on-base transport. Electric vehicles would actually be a great idea for military installations: decreases vehicle maintenance costs, range isn't a significant factor, electricity is cheaper than fuel (particularly when the average base transport vehicle is more of a miles/gallon situation), towing isn't a problem since range isn't a problem and electric motors are capable of impressive towing numbers, scalable/modular electric platforms can be applied towards a variety of vehicle types (people transport, machinery towing, aircraft towing, materials transport, security forces patrol vehicles).

There are *significant* technological advances that need to be made before EVs will ever have a significant presence even near a battlefield, but the military spends inordinate amounts of money maintaining and fueling gas vehicles that spend their whole lives on/around a single installation.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"Damn tied the Rivian R1T in the Doug score. Basically summed it up as Hummer > R1T overall, but for the price the R1T is better. 

I remember when I was little I was obsessed with Hummers and them going away was so heartbreaking because I thought I’d never get a chance at owning one as an adult. This thing though is everything I could’ve imagined as a kid that a futuristic Hummer would be. 

Unfortunately reality is a thing and I 1) can’t spend that much on a car 2) have absolutely no need for a pickup truck or car that enormous. Maybe I’ll rent one in a year or two to bring back my nostalgia for a weekend.",103,,2021-12-16,0.129,0.029,-0.9082

The motorized tonneau cover

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"cost:    Cybertruck much cheaper than Hummer, Rivian cheaper as well

weight: Cybertruck lighter, Rivian in middle, Hummer huge and heavy

off-road gear: Hummer all the way, except for its size

in-cab features: Hummer has a bunch, Cybertruck will likely have the full Tesla experience

marketing: GM is bracketing with the cheapest long-range EV and the fanciest truck, just as they don't bother competing with Toyota and Honda in gas cars today. The hugely powerful Hummer is going to make a big media splash, so that seems ( even to me, a many-years truck owner who would never buy  a $40K truck, let alone $120K) like a smart play until they can get the Silverado done.

batteries: I am guessing they are held back by battery supply until the giant plants are up&running. So is Tesla, just at an order of magnitude more.

and- Audi Etron weighs 5600 lbs! Mustang weighs 4600lbs! Taycan is no Twiggy, either.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"i can't believe this vehicle is so divisive. People are completely okay with huge semis driving around with pallets full of god knows what. But a full size truck? ""OMG"". What about this thing makes people so angry? It's a nice large vehicle with lots of room for adventuring. Obviously not a commuter city car and not pretending to be. Does every EV need to be a sedan or hatchback? It almost seems like the people who insisted Tesla was going to be the only electric car manufacturer ever, are now feeling pretty dumb watching all these nice EVs coming out from a variety of manufacturers, and all they can do now is spew hot air because its very obvious that these are real vehicles, and actually coming out.

Then there are the europeans who are eternally confused. Let me clear it up for y'all. The USA has large, wide streets, and is gigantic. Oil was really cheap here for a long time and still is relatively speaking. So we built our society around the vehicle, and we didn't have the same restrictions that exist in europe like having to design around ancient cities with small streets. So we built our road network to allow nice large vehicles that allow a full family to ride around in total comfort. You would have done exactly the same thing if you lived here. So we have all these nice big wide streets, big garages, and the country is gigantic, which allows us to get large vehicles, and they're awesome.",1,,2021-04-24,0.048,0.178,0.9896

Out of Spec did a cross country “race” using the WT (work truck version) and it beat all of the other pick up trucks (including Cybertruck). What’s more impressive is it did it while relying on EA chargers. I think the R1T and F150 Lightning are going to be in a world of trouble when that truck comes out.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r1e8oOnT7yE

It's not even like a dug out channel, more like some dirt getting eroded by water and it sort of dips a little at a gentle angle. If it can't take a non challenging dirt road like this how tf is it going to handle actual difficult terrain? What they traveled on is frankly more level than what you find on dirt roads around farms where tractors create actual ditches when it rains. It's not even user error, the Hummer EV off roading abilities have become decrepit and feeble. Do not even dare to accuse the driver, he didn't drive into a ditch on the side of the road, he was on a dirt road that had like a gentle depression in it and heavens forbid, it required the truck to have an actual good approach and departure angle and stiffer suspension to not bottom out on a gentle, not even half a meter slope.

**To The Moon: GM and Lockheed Martin's New Lunar Rover, Rendered**  
GM is going back to the moon, but this time partnered with Lockheed Martin for ""moon buggies.""

[https://www.motortrend.com/news/gm-design-lockheed-martin-new-lunar-rover-renderings/](https://www.motortrend.com/news/gm-design-lockheed-martin-new-lunar-rover-renderings/)

According to GM back in May of 2021, these next-generation lunar rover vehicles are being designed to drive even farther distances to support the first excursions of the Moon's south pole. These new LRVs will also need better technology beyond their capacities as the south pole is **dark, making it much colder** with much more rugged terrain and the sunlit surfaces the Apollo missions landed in.  
Fortunately, **GM's Ultium technologies will most likely help create the drive and battery packs** these new rovers need. These new rovers will also be **autonomous**, allowing them to launch prior to the human landings. This is needed to help prepare for ""commercial payload services and enhance the range and utility of scientific payloads and experiments"" according to GM.

AVL is billed as an industry leader for the development, simulation, and testing of vehicle systems and will be used for its expertise in the advancement of battery electric vehicles, autonomous driving, and propulsion solutions. Intuitive Machines and their Nova-D spacecraft will be used to bring the LTV to the Moon using four liquid methane/oxygen engines from their Nova-C program. Lunar Outpost—a leader in lunar mobility platforms according to Northrop—will leverage its **dust mitigation and thermal technologies from the development of its MAPP rover to help develop similar solutions for the LTV.**",2,,2023-06-29,0.0,0.103,0.9803

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"The Electric Hummer with Crab Walk mode oh man! What a fun truck that would turn out to be one day! 

The idea is with Crab Walk mode you could theoretically design car ports on the sides of larger ships/transportation vehicles that could deploy hummers engaged in Crab Mode versus needing to be reversed and come out the rear of a trailer or drop plane, you could instead have a garage drop box that could offer a hummer to drive sideways into a port that was the same shape of the vehicle and wouldn't open but could be pushed in using the Hummer while engaged in Crab Mode, think camo garage you no longer need a full drive way and seeable roads that lead up to the entrance of a bunker.

Crab Mode drive sideways into a slot along a wall and suddenly it opens and you Crab Walk on in and the door shuts, not a standard issue garage door but the Hummer EV isn't a standard issue vehicle and so should the ideas on how to approach using it in a military aspect. You can probably design something that could fit multiple hummer's along a wall side and they all engage Crab Walk and can be drive out instantly on both sides of an enclosed trailer, could even fit in 4 at a time if the floors elevated and offered multilevel storage, you could hypothetically launch four complete Hummers engaged in Crab Walk mode almost instantaneously with full teams and gear loaded and ready if you launched them from the sides of a trailer instead of the rear where you have to drop one at a time, with Crab Mode and fast elevator garage lift system you could even just drop the walls and turn them into ramps that could then be used to crab walk down over the other hummer as it's using the bottom half of the wall as a ramp to do the same.

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"I’m honestly confused about why these cars (along with the Raptor, TREX, etc) exists other than to attract attention. 

- They fail at the basic purpose of full size trucks, which is to tow over any appreciable distance (most in the double digit range, about a third of a comparably sized conventional truck)

- They’re fast in a straight line, but handle far worse than even the most basic sporty sedans and even a lot of SUVs

- They’re also 6 figures in cost.

So what we have are several trucks that can’t tow, handle worse than a sports sedan/wagon/SUV, and cost over double the average vehicle cost. Who are these for?

*edit: my overarching point is that for everything these vehicles do, there is a type of car that objectively does it better. So acknowledging that, these vehicles are mostly for forcing people to acknowledge you*",0,,2024-05-13,0.076,0.056,-0.631

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"of course we all knew this was coming... though nice to see the 400 mile range. It makes sense. Hummer EV truck will do 350 miles with the big battery.

We know from the Hummer SUV reveal that it has a shorter wheelbase than the truck version and it has a 20 module battery pack instead of the Hummer truck's 24 module pack.

And the Cybertruck and R1T will also be on the market by that time, but I'm not sure how much appeal the Cybertruck will have to the type of people who take out 96-month loans on loaded F-150 / F-250s, Silverados, and Rams.

In a week you will see your racist uncle ranting on Facebook about how he heard EV's cost $100 in electricity to ""fill up"".

This article really is bullshit too.  Yes, it could theoretically cost that much at a DC charging station...  But consider most EV's have a much smaller battery, most people charge at home, and most people aren't charging from 0-100%.  Those are 3 big factors that make this article's scenario unlikely.

A few more things to consider: Many new EV's come with a free subscription for DC charging (limited use).  Most people are only utilizing DC charging 1-2 times on a road trip (unless you are driving cross country or something).

This is like a worst case scenario being reported in this article.  I personally pay around $15 to fully charge my EV when charging at home.  I use a DC fast charger once every two months or so and it's currently free as a limited subscription with my lease.",5,,2022-11-17,0.098,0.078,-0.4471

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"I’m really interested to see how the Ultium platform works out. 

It seems to me that one of Tesla’s biggest advantages as a startup was that they don’t have any car platform, and hadn’t built up a business and corporate structure around the kind of compartmentalized optimization that makes sense when building a highly complex and mature piece of technology like a car. 

As a result, they didn’t have the mentality of digging through the parts bin to save costs, as there was no parts bin. And that sounds disparaging of parts bins - in fact, companies like VW and Toyota are able to make incredibly good engines and transmissions, as well as switchgear and shock absorbers and all the rest, because they’ve got so much volume to spread the costs out between, and can have small, highly effective teams working on each part. And with a mature technology, you already know about what the optimal solution looks like; engineering between parts and teams is far less critical than it is with a truly new product, in which you don’t know what optimal is. 

Anyway, the point is not to talk about Tesla, but to say that as EVs mature, the commoditized approach of highly developed platforms, where it’s easy to add new vehicles in new segments, and core things like batteries and motors get used over and over again - that’s where things will probably go. 

Ultium and MEB are the two platforms we’ve seen the most technical detail about, at least that I’ve seen the most detail about. They both seem super flexible and well thought out, so it should be interesting to see how quickly GM can turn the platform into a whole array of different vehicles, as VW is starting to do.",7,,2021-12-18,0.021,0.16,0.9895

Doesn't like the brakes, perhaps not surprising given that much weight, nor the fact that the front locking hubs require holding the button for 5 seconds, which he didn't realize until he'd had to back off a steep rocky climb when he couldn't figure that out.

Another point is the dreadful efficiency, which is why they crammed in such a massive battery. One point I hadn't considered is that despite a decent onboard charger of 11.5 kw, that means 12 hours for a 70% charge. Can you get DC charging at home?

FYI, they took 0.5 seconds off the 0-60 with the software boost update, [as tested by C&D](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a36329678/2019-tesla-model-3-performance-by-the-numbers/).

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"I finally bothered to get a GPS drag timer and I got a ~3.95 5-60 (there's no 5-60 readout so you have to just sorta eyeball the graph) just rolling onto the throttle with a 718 Cayman S PDK. But my car is tuned and I was using 100 octane for the runs (it's ""only"" 50% more expensive than 91 now lol). The tune is a measly 15hp on the top end, but it's like 50 ftlb of torque for some of the previously worst bits of the 3k-ish rpm range, which I image helps a lot for just rolling onto the throttle.

Still only managed a 0-60 3.85s with LC though. Never got a clean launch, always had some wheelspin (maybe the tune means more torque is delivered than what the ECU expects?).

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"I still don't get why you think 5-60 is more realistic. It's incredibly easy to engage launch control in the Golf R, yet I can't think of many if any situations where I would mash the throttle while creeping along at 5mph. Talk about unrepresentative of normal driving. How is a situation that rarely actually occurs more ""real life""? 

I'm not saying that launch control isn't gimmicky, moreso that 5-60 is even less representative of typical driving. Not to mention it's literally a worse case scenario for a big turbo small engine cars like mine especially if you're not still in first gear. 

It seems like it's just hunting for a harder metric for turbo cars when many of them do a pretty good job hiding turbo lag these days under actual normal usage scenarios, especially when ECU + TCU tuned. I'd argue 0-60 no rollout with launch control off, 30-50, 50-70 and 60-130 are all more useful ""real world"" metrics than 5-60. My car won't lug from a stop the way it would at 5mph if gunned, and I know it's not the only one.",3,,2022-08-04,0.07,0.097,0.7684
Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"5-60 is arguably an arguably worse metric for performance. 

It's a metric that favors regular everyday cars which a) don't have launch control b) don't have much mechanical grip and c) prioritize power and response lower in the RPM range where the car is most usually driven. 

Whether they're NA or FI, most sports cars make their power at higher RPMs (big displacement NA cars notwithstanding). The trade-off is often a lack of torque at lower RPM's, but this is generally a non-issue as most (if not all) performance driving is done at some sort of speed. Remedying this lack of low-end torque is launch control, but for some reason that's silly. 

Has launch control become a way for manufacturers to game 0-60 times? Yes, but 5-60 is no better as a meaningful measurement of performance. When would one need to go full throttle from a walking speed? Not on a track, not at a drag strip, not even on the street would you be in a situation where you need to go from 5-60. If you're doing 5mph willingly, it's because you're stuck in traffic - you're not getting to 60 as quickly as you can in gridlock. 

None of these are ""better reflections of a cars performance"", just go look at lap times and stop the circle jerk over your Rav4 being faster than a Supra.",4,,2022-08-04,0.1,0.06,-0.8024

Comment,GMC Hummer EV,"This is still in very optimal conditions likely prepped track conditions.  So from that respect it still doesn't reflect real world driving experience.  

Some of these cars will be squirrely as hell on the road trying to get anywhere near these numbers while others will be much more planted and easier to repeat.  Traction will be a bigger issue than power, whether it's EV or ICE, modern cars are all kinda leaning on the fact that they can leverage ABS and TC type functions to just throw GOBS of power out and let the car keep things in line.  

Can you imagine these cars without those functions at work?  It would be the old days where only folks who want the rush, and risk, of big power and questionable traction would drive these things.

But what that means is that as the traction situation improves, ABS and TC can stop getting involved and let you maximize all that power, so you can kinda cheat the list there.  Make a car that will NEVER be anywhere near able to use all the power it can make unless it's on a very well treated race track and then say 'well it does 0-60 or 5-60 in XX seconds'.  Sure...if you only ever drive on a drag strip.  Otherwise there are more important factors...like AWD really shining in less than perfect road conditions.  

Again, this applies to EV's ad much as ICE.  You aren't getting that amazing 0-60 in your tesla performance on the road, take it to the track sometime and see what it feels like to not have the computer cut power to reduce slippage.",0,,2022-08-04,0.07,0.089,0.7006

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"A new electric Silverado means an electric Tahoe/Yukon/Suburban likely aren't far behind.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"As a ""if I had to get an American car, it'd be a Ford"" guy, I'll be honest in saying I have a fondness for GM recently.

If the hummer pans out, I think I'd absolutely trust GM over Ford for EVs. Ford's EV portfolio is a mess, and doesn't give me confidence that they actually have a product or plan. Shared stuff with Rivian, shared stuff with VW, Ford's battery supplier penalized for some sort of IP infringement. Unless Ford announces something real big, or the rivian products are crazy good, I don't have any confidence in Ford to pull off an EV portfolio as big as it's planning. The Mach E does help, though.

I'm so intrigued by the ""new"" GM. I'm not used to seeing them make....not-crappy vehicles. So we'll see. I'm optimistic. Definitely rooting for them.",81,,2021-04-06,0.083,0.156,0.9021

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I would be more interested if there are more full size PHEV SUVs. If I can get 40-50 mile range, that will cover 90% of my driving. And for the occasional long road trips I go on, I’d have the convenience of using gas instead of waiting around to charge or limited charging stations. Yes, Tesla has a lot of charging stations, but I like to go camping about 4 times a year where it’s not by interstates so I’d be stuck on level 2 Chargers which are too slow to wait around on road trips.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Nice work by GM, they have impressive EV tech. No doubt they will have strong EV offerings to come. I grew up in a GM family and root for them. 

Now, I am curious about EV impact on cars in general though. What happens to cars like Civic SI, Elantra N line, Golf GTI, Veloster/Elantra N, Corolla, Camaro, Mustang, Challenger, Charger, BRZ/86, Golf R, and the rest of that segment in the 20-50K range that offer manual transmissions, good overall range, and lightweight sporty/sports cars(with some exceptions)? Do automakers want to kill these cars soon or will they fight for them to remain ICE? 

If these cars go EV, how heavy will they be and get they offer similar value or will they get much more costly? Like if Honda Civic SI went EV, I don't see it how they can make it fun with pure EV powertrain, cost 26K, have solid range, and be lightweight. 

So far, we have seen Camaro might be killed off, rumors of Camaro-like EV, Mustang due to go full EV but with suv offering and now supposed sedan offerring on the way. Mustang coupe may die off? Challenger/Charger living on until 2024 with ICE. No news on what comes after that. Automakers are not addressing this besides Porsche which is conflicted on Cayman/Boxster future and wants 911 to remain ICE/Hybrid for a long time.",2,,2021-04-06,0.067,0.093,-0.5126

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I don’t know what the hell the deal is with these things.  Have they been released for a year?  Have they only been available and tested for the last three months or so?  There were questions on the range because it would seem like it would be great from its EPA rating, and it was pretty good.  But that was only found out recently? From a press car or from an actual privately owned vehicle?

The fact that I’m fairly aware of the EV market yet am not sure whether this is actually being produced yet, with other more casual buyers being just completely unaware of its existence should be a sign that their marketing is beyond fucked.  ",1,,2024-07-29,0.111,0.081,-0.7878

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"The only reason they are discounting the EV is to get under the 80k requirement for the tax credit.  Then it might sell.  96k-16k=80k.  They never should have tried to sell an EV for 96k.  

The F-150 gets 310 range and nobody complains.  When you add the Tesla network, then its a non-issue.

When you look at regular trucks, the gas tanks normally have 24 gallons (Silverado 1500).  The range under perfect conditions would be around 500 miles.  Under normal conditions, you'll probably get 380 miles (70mph, hills, acceleration, running AC, etc).  When you tow heavy stuff, cut that in half for 190 miles.  

That's similar for EV's too.  Adding options and a super long range prices it off the market.  They should have taken the Ford approach.",1,,2024-07-29,0.034,0.074,0.7579

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"There's a few reasons.  

The first is to hold public interest.  Why do you think there's Pepsi ads that just say 'Pepsi' and nothing else?  Why do companies pay millions to plaster their logo everywhere?  Not even an ad, just a logo?  To keep themselves in your mind.  

The reason for this is twofold.  The first is more for low and mid range cars- so when it's time to get a car, you think of that company.  Hopefully with a positive impression.  Maybe 3-4 months down the road you'll need a car and remember that superbowl ad with the flashy EV.  

The second is reinforcement.  This is more for luxury cars.  Most luxury car ads aren't actually to sell cars- they are to reinforce the purchase decision of someone who's either already planning to buy, or has recently ordered.  That person WANTS to see that they just made the right choice, and the ad gives them exactly what they want--  you chose right, this car has the best technology and whatever.  

Then of course is the simple fact that they have the ad budget and aren't going to NOT spend it.  If they advertise ICE cars they will seem outdated (since everyone else is pushing EVs).  So they spend it.  

And let's not forget a lot of people will go to a dealer looking for an EV and get talked into an ICE car or hybrid.",3,,2022-10-31,0.015,0.076,0.934

They act somewhat as a halo produced, and they make people better about their meal choice even if they don't opt for the healthy option.

And of course it makes the fast food brand seem health conscious (even if 99% of their sales are not those items)

So for an automaker, the mere existence of an EV in the lineup means they can win the brand green cred, and the brand seem more environmentally conscious (even if they sell zero or a low number)

There are also a couple more factors at play.

* Sends the message to both consumers and regulators that the brand is working on EV's. So there isn't a need for consumers to leave the brand for a brand with better environmental credentials, and there isn't a need for regulators to take harsh action on vehicle emissions.
* An attempt to retain their loyal customers, who might stay with the brand  if they know there is an EV in the pipeline (perhaps even buying another non-plug-in car in the meantime), rather than deciding they need to leave their favorite brand to get an EV, and they might as well do it now.",2,,2022-10-31,0.029,0.119,0.97

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Note that this is a 450 mile range for the Work Truck (WT) version, which is **huge.** And this is actual EPA-estimated range! Though it looks like Chevrolet's website has not been updated to reflect this yet.

The quote in question:

>Chevrolet has some electrifyingly good news to share today! The Silverado EV Work Truck’s EPA-estimated range is in: 450 miles on a full charge. With this official estimate, the Silverado EV WT is expected to offer over 100 miles more than its closest on-sale competitor.

By contrast, the Ford F-150 Lighting Pro is only available with the 230-mile standard battery (EDIT: at least to consumers, Fleets can get the ER). Once the WT goes on sale, Ford will be solidly on the defensive. And the Cybertruck was originally projected to have ""only"" 300 miles of range in its dual motor configuration.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I'm of the opinion that for a large majority of people, the 300-350 range is plenty. Not saying there aren't edge cases, but rather that the people who say they aren't getting an EV until they can get 400-500 miles of range are either just using it as an excuse to not get an EV or are unrealistic as hell. Don't know if we will ever see that much range on EV sedans unless battery energy density goes up and prices come down. And even if that happens, faster charging would make more range unnecessary. So it may never happen. 

That said, pickup trucks are different. 350 miles of range can be half that while towing so up to 600 would be welcome on trucks.

Give me a 90s style Ranger or Tacoma sized truck. I need to be able to toss some bags of mulch or 2x4s into the bed, not three cubic yards of gravel. That's what a fucking trailer is for.

I hate American style trucks so much. Even the current Ranger is 211"" long. 1993 model was 181-198"" and I've never ONCE been unable to fit what I needed into the back of a classic Ranger. **NOT ONCE**. 20 years of living on a farm when I was young, never needed a bigger truck. And I definitely didn't need 2' is clearance or whatever the fuck they have now. That's just BEGGING to get your catalytic converter stolen (not that an EV worries about that, but still). It also makes your car more prone to flipping over because your COG.

And even if I did, I would just use a trailer.",-2,,2023-05-19,0.068,0.038,-0.4705

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"450 miles of range with zero weight added. All independent tests of the Rivian and Ford trucks with comparable kWh capacity and curb weight can barely get over 100 miles with a moderately sized trailer. It's also funny how the automakers refuse to comment on this besides saying the efficiency drop is comparable to an ICE vehicle, which is demonstrably false.

Of course, the argument is that these use cases are few and far between, which is true. But in those cases, people don't need to be buying these land barges in the first place.

The shift to electric was the perfect opportunity to change the status quo on vehicle overconsumption, but the automakers will never give up their cash cows.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Thoughts:

Some GM engineer discovered some dusty GM feature book from 20 years ago and decided to get his promotion by bringing up 4 wheel steering and a midgate during a product meeting- both are previous GM features that have total diehards but haven't been revived since.

1. It's an avalanche. The 60/40 split midgate is awesome. If I recall correctly the previous avalanche midgate was a full bench, so you couldn't have someone in the back at all. This configuration allows for 8ft lumber + someone to sit in back. 

2. The ""E"" branding is so weird.

3. Pricing: I suppose it's fine. Very competitive with the lightning and truthfully I think the Silverado is a more compelling product.

4. I also think it looks good. The Silverado is obviously geared for non-truck people. The Sierra variant is absolutely being styled for traditional truck buyers- this is where GM having two seperate truck nameplates is going to be BIG, whereas before Silverado/Sierra buyers were the same people with different preferences.

You can really see the advantage that a dedicated EV platform (Hummer/Silverado EV) has over a retrofitted ICE (Lightning), and I'm sure driving dynamics will match as well.

I really think they should have just called it the avalanche. I get that Silverado is a recognizable nameplate, and also that ""Avalanche"" is literally a natural disaster, but GM is reviving names for their EVs anyways (Hummer, Buick Electra)

I'm also extremely curious how GM estimated their range values. Given that the RST is quoted at 400 miles with the massive 24"" rims, you could seriously expect a Silverado with a smaller wheel size (like the steelies on the WT) to do double-digit % better. Though if they're smart they'll downsize the packs rather than push for 400+ (there's no point when you already offer 100 more miles than the competition).

Having the RST trim be the top for the Silverado is odd- given that RST is traditionally below LTZ and High Country for the ICE Silverados. I wonder if they'd prefer to get rid of the LTZ/HC to uplevel them to Sierras instead. If they can avoid losing people in transition to the Lightning Platinum trim it would save GM a lot of money in terms of packaging.",71,,2022-01-05,0.051,0.144,0.9911

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"> the electric Silverado will be incredibly quick, able to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in less than 4.5 seconds. That’s quicker than the RWD single-motor Cybertruck and about on par with the Ford F-150 Lightning and the tri-motor Cybertruck. (Tesla says the quad-motor truck will be able to hit 60 mph in 2.9 seconds.)

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"my first thoughts are that i like the exterior, but i want to see a mid trim LT version with a longer bed. it appears to have the best interior of anything I've seen this year... much better than the f150 lightning interior. the specs are good, the features and capability are good, except payload is pretty low (1200 pounds). towing capability is obviously good, how could it not be. efficiency isn't great, but i don't think anyone thought it would be incredibly efficient. it's a full size truck designed to work, tow and haul. if that isn't what you intend to do, then there are much more efficient vehicles out there for you to buy.

i absolutely love the mid gate. its one of those features that makes the vehicle incredibly versatile. i just hope they don't think they can get away with not offering a longer bed because of it.

pricing is about what I expected. we are 2-3 years out from actually being able to buy one, so that will give me plenty of time to save up. Overall, this is very likely going to be my next big vehicle purchase, so I'm pretty excited. my current Silverado is still going strong but I'm really looking forward to switching out for electric. I've had far less maintenance issues with my Chevy trucks (vs Ford) so that is the reason I'm sticking with GM. I like the Rivian but the bed is too small and i don't trust that vehicle with a thousand pounds of rocks in the bed. so right now, basically I'm just waiting for this truck to get mass produced. I'm in no rush but seeing the truck now is fun.",36,,2022-01-05,0.046,0.204,0.9959

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I know they need to match the look of a traditional pickup for sales, but one of these manufacturers should really make a true work truck that leans in to the advantages of electric. Rather than a frunk, push the passenger compartment forward into more of a cab-over design. Much improved visibility, and you could probably fit a crew cab and an 8 foot bed with the space savings. 

Would probably only sell to fleets, which may not be worth it until EVs are more common. But *that* would be a real truck of the future.",11,,2022-01-05,0.019,0.137,0.9293
Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I think the biggest news with this truck is the death of frame on rails.

One of the major manufacturers of the 1/2 ton truck is now making a unibody truck. That means the next generation Ford will have to decide if it is frame on rails or unibody. I suspect that they will go unibody. 

Just a note, the maverick is unibody. And it gets great mpg and it is cheap. The Cybertruck and Rivian are unibody as well. The lightning and ram seem to be the only frame on rails truck left. Who knows what the new Silverado will be, but I'm guessing this is a huge indication that the new Silverado will be unibody as well. 

That's a MASSIVE change in the truck world. It means the trucks will be less modular and more efficient. They'll also drive more like cars and handle better. I honestly don't think there is a major downside with going away from the frame other than manufacturing is more expensive if you want to have different layouts.",10,,2022-01-05,0.036,0.136,0.963
Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"So I do really like this, but I’m a bit disappointed about one thing - GM builds a dedicated EV platform that gets worse efficiency (2mi/kWH) than Ford (2.3mi/kWh), who just stuffed a battery in the existing platform, and Rivian (2.33mi/kWh)? I assume that this is due to the weight of the big battery, but I was hoping for something with efficiency on par with Rivian and Ford. I suppose that the 350kW charging helps, but still

I traded a 24 xlt for a pre-owned 23 lightning xlt standard range for 44k I'm in heaven. The 24 was my 1st full-sized pickup truck, paying 100 every week and a half on gas was an eye-opener.

I think the EV sector will do better if they stop giving everyone free lvl 3 charges for a year or 2 and start giving credits towards installing level 2 chargers at home like Ford will start doing this month.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"My frequent destination airport Budget Rental lot (Denver) has a ton of Silverado EVs. As a potential buyer of an RST, I was eager to rent one and see if I liked it. 

First off, it was near impossible to get one despite there being 15+ on the pick-up (vs drop-off) side of the lot!  I asked for one and the space they assigned me was a Ford Lightning.  I went back in with the location of several Silverado EVs. NONE were fully charged and they ended up sending me out on one with 30% charge.

These rental companies all over bought and don’t have the charging infrastructure to get them ready.  It’s rather ridiculous.

As many of you know, renting an EV sucks anyway - unless your hotel has chargers, your office has chargers (if traveling for work), or if you know you can find an ultra fast charger near a mall / restaurant that you can hang out at on the night before you return.

Back to the Silverado EV…. 

I gotta say, the Silverado WT just isn’t impressive to me compared to other EVs - aside from range.  The acceleration is meh, the cabin is utilitarian.  Your coffee or water bottle will slide around and even tip over because the cup holders are just huge round circles.  There is a vertical slot for your cellphone, but there isn’t room for anything else unless you toss it into the ridiculously huge and perhaps bottomless pit between the dash and cup holders.  

The dash has many different cut-outs and textures that serve to only annoyingly reflect against the windshield. 

The ui is not intuitive - my happiest moment was figuring out how to simply turn off the headlights.  

And the cabin rattles.  This thing rattled more than my 20+ year old Avalanche!

Hey, at least it had Apple CarPlay.

The RST needs to be a huge cabin and acceleration upgrade for me to consider it.  The WT is not a great demo for such a pricey platform.",1,,2025-03-04,0.034,0.064,0.8657
Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I'm super pro-EV (both our cars are EV's), but I'd never rent one, especially a CCS model.

I’ll tow a 7000 lb trailer across Canada in winter. Just charge more often. 
Non Ev drivers don’t understand the need for planning. And that getting to your destination with no charge left, becisse they maxed it out, is also not desirable.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Considering that ram has just announced that their EV, if it ever gets to market, will no longer have the extended range pack, and will instead opt for about the same range that we already have in the lightning, and the Tesla came in nowhere near expected range, and considering that the Silverado is significantly more expensive when you get that bigger pack, I don't expect to see Ford make any major change here anytime soon. 

When ram was still promising the longer range, and with Silverado having it, and before the cyber truck launched and proved that their range was much lower, I always figured that market pressures were forced forward into the longer range. But realistically, looking at current available trucks on the market, both current and planned, I don't think they really need to do it from a market pressure perspective anymore.",2,,2025-01-23,0.064,0.021,-0.6757

No way is a truck at 50-60k+ affordable especially when you consider some states are charging extra for registration, higher insurance rates, and the cost of a charging station at home. No thanks.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Two things:

First, all marketing and promotional materials for this vehicle have, so far, acted as if it is an Avalanche that they just happen to be calling a Silverado.  To make the mid-gate completely unavailable in the WT trims (of which I presume there are 4) is utterly baffling to me.  I don't get it at all.  Why even offer a Silverado EV model that doesn't have it?  I just don't get the logic there.

Second, they are absolutely stoned out of their minds if they think it's reasonable to have the 3WT cost only about $5k less than the 4WT (a price drop of 6.25% down from $80k) while taking a 100 mile range hit (a drop of 22.2% down from 450 miles).  I get it that it's not just the range that is different between the two, and it's not just the range that gives the 4WT its worth, but that's downright insulting to me.  Why even bother offering a 3WT if you're gonna give people 100 more miles of range for just $5k more?  Do they even want to sell 3WTs?",48,,2023-06-26,0.057,0.015,-0.8458

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I was all-in on a $45,000 Silverado EV because I thought it would be a great city vehicle, especially with the mid-gate.  

$75,000?  Holy F, that is a lot of money for any car, especially one with the Silverado's interior.  The infotainment takes ""just slappa tablet on there and call it a day"" to a new extreme.

Now I get having cheap, easy to clean and hard to scratch plastics in work trucks.  I genuinely do.  However in a $75,000 vehicle?  Get outta town!

Chevy has done some great things with this vehicle.  The CoD is amazing for a vehicle with those capabilities.  The Ultium platform has proven to be very competitive, even with Tesla who remains the clear leader in EV drivetrains.

In my trade (elevators/escalators) companies provide fleet vehicles to almost every journeyman. They come with gas cards like most fleets do. 

I guess we could charge a mileage stipend to pay for it. But most of us drive 100-300 miles a day for work anyways. I don’t know, seems like a bit amount of limitations just in my trade.

If you are willing to give up a little on that range, then prices should be a lot lower while payload might go up some, while dropping the price.

Overall, I think Chevy did a great job on this work truck for those that need it.  It is a first generation product so things will only improve from here on out.

As a result, a Ford-150 Lightning would only be credited with 67.1 mpg, down from 237.7 mpg. But taken altogether, the Administration’s proposed revisions would in effect mandate that EVs make up 100% of new vehicles by 2032.

>Detroit auto makers would be slammed harder than foreign competitors by the regulatory changes because pick-ups and SUVs make up a larger share of their fleet sales. “The average projected compliance cost per vehicle for the D3 is $2,151, while non-D3 auto manufacturers only see an increase of $546 per vehicle,” the Big Three recently told the Energy Department.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"People really see nothing wrong with shoulder-height pickups? This trend of making vehicles bigger and bigger for no reason other than being a status symbol is the worst… and you KNOW the vast majority of users will use them as commuters exclusively, just like most pickups on the road right now, so for the love of all living things please spare the tired “but what about those who need it for work??”. Contractors use vans in most of the word, and pickups that actually seem to be used for actual work are almost always older and smaller ones, which have an actually useful bed instead of this Silverado with a huge cabin taking more than half the space (because, again, this isn’t sold with workers in mind first).

Even as an EV, this thing will be inefficient, require a shit ton of materials and lithium/cobalt to be built undermining any difference with ICEs, and will be just as lethal (or maybe more due to better acceleration and speed) than any grossly oversized trucks and SUVs, especially with children who are invisible to these.",22,,2022-06-04,0.064,0.102,0.8353

It seems like the better move to me, and it shows in the specs. Even Ford has said they are bringing out a new lightning in 2025 with a ground up EV platform. The current F150 lightning is a lame duck and i'd be very surprised if a majority of reservation holders actually convert to sales. However, i do know that there is a large contingent of Ford fanboys out there who grew up in a ""Ford family"" and wouldn't buy anything else. Also, there seems to be a contingent of people who just want an EV truck at all costs as soon as possible, and they don't seem to care that its an ICE conversion. I don't understand why these people can't just wait 2-3 years and get something more modern but hey, if you absolutely must have an EV truck within 1-2 years and don't mind spending a huge amount of money on an ICE conversion vehicle that will be obsolete in a couple years, more power to you?",3,,2022-02-03,0.031,0.061,0.4988

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"of course we all knew this was coming... though nice to see the 400 mile range. It makes sense. Hummer EV truck will do 350 miles with the big battery. So the Chevy Silverado version should do 400 since it won't have all the heavy off road components, huge wheels and tires, etc. I'm interested to know about wheel base and pack size. We know from the Hummer SUV reveal that it has a shorter wheelbase than the truck version and it has a 20 module battery pack instead of the Hummer truck's 24 module pack. Will the silverado be on the short or extended wheel base? How many modules will it get?",34,,2021-04-06,0.0,0.069,0.7998
Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"The current Silverado and Sierra went on sale as 2019 models, so an all-new Silverado would be for model year 2024... late 2023 maybe? And then perhaps the new SUVs a year or two afterward...

The F-150 EV will likely beat it to the market, but it might be handicapped due to being based on an existing ICE vehicle.

And the Cybertruck and R1T will also be on the market by that time, but I'm not sure how much appeal the Cybertruck will have to the type of people who take out 96-month loans on loaded F-150 / F-250s, Silverados, and Rams.

That means it’s gonna be less efficient, the extra 80kw is nice but it’s got 8 lug hubs, and even heavier running gear. It’s probably not a fair comparison, like comparing an HD to 1/2 ton in efficiency. But….

The heavy Chevy will also only carry 1300lbs of payload, my Lightning has 1700lbs and carries my 900lb tongue weight and still is rear high.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Honestly for me: yes. I have an Escalade IQ on order. Our family contemplated at length regarding the Sierra EV or the Escalade IQ to replace the Lightning. The biggest reasons for the switch ended up being:


 - Range. We drive from SF to Tahoe almost weekly (supercommuters) and the extra range really does mean the difference between needing or not needing to stop to charge. The Lightning is only about 5% away in summer and 10-15% away in winter. 
 - Improved interior comfort: the Lightning rear row is a little bumpy for backseat passenger
 - Needs changing. Ultimately we realized we no longer do as many truck things as we once did and now we’d rather be able to fit our guests plus dog into one vehicle when they visit.

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I mean, yeah, it is. But I do three trips a year that my Lightning can't one-shot, and a maxed Silverado would probably only save me two to five hours a year, so I'm actually more interested in the longer bed than the battery, but I'm not gonna trade my truck out when it consistently gets the job done and my life is probably gonna get lighter-duty from here anyway.",3,,2024-12-09,0.0,0.129,0.8717

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"I'm betting those are WT trucks, which means you're missing a whole bunch of features that we take for granted:

\- no supercruise (bluecruise  equivalent)

\- no Android auto/apple carplay

\- rougher suspension

\- slower acceleration

\- lower end interior, with lots of hard plastics

And then it also ends up missing some of the features that people are looking to Chevy for: 

\- the mid gate

\- 4 wheel steering 

  
guess if the only thing you were looking for is range, and that's the only consideration for comparing between the two, then it might be good for you. But if that's the case, I'm assuming you're already driving a pro in the lightning, which means that the price listed is not that big a steel compared to a used Pro. But if you need the range, I guess it could be a good deal.",1,,2024-12-09,0.06,0.048,0.2732

Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,">Really the biggest change appears to be in the wheels and tires. Each of them have unique designs, but they have the same dimensions. They're 18-inch wheels with 285/75R18 tires. That comes out to just shy of 35 inches in diameter, a good size of tire for an off-roader — and note how it doesn't even look all that large on such big trucks. Said tires are Goodyear Wrangler Territory AT all-terrains. The gas-powered trucks come with slightly narrower (275) mud-terrain versions as standard.

Considering the impact of rolling resistance on EV range, I'm surprised they didn't just give these the same narrower tyres, unless there's an EV-specific Wrangler model with improved rolling resistance (or the weight rating of the standard tyres wasn't high enough).",3,,2024-07-10,0.019,0.077,0.8338
Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"Where's the Colorado/Canyon EV? And the Ranger Lightning? Those are what I'm holding out for. I love my 2015 Colorado, and I'm ready to replace it with an EV version.",3,,2024-07-10,0.0,0.201,0.7941
Comment,Chevy Silverado EV,"These are going to be prohibitively expensive, unfortunately. The WT variant is overpriced by at least $20,0000.  There's no way these will be attainable for the majority of the target demographic. I don't really understand who these vehicles are for.",0,,2024-07-10,0.108,0.0,-0.5574
